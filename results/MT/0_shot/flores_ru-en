 For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of road development.
 However, the national road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed, allowing to reduce the cost of owning a car.
 Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating the resulting injuries.
