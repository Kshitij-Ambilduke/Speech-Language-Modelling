 This not only proves the widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
 According to scientists, the plumage of this bird was brownish-red with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
 The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
 The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
 The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or to look good. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows adult feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
 The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

 The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program is written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
 Similar to how the moon exerts force on the earth, which leads to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
 The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
 According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy cluster is located in a ring around the galaxy, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

 In France, voting has traditionally required little technology: voters go to a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope marked with the candidate they are voting for.
 Officials first check the voter's identity, then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voting roll.
 The process is relatively tightly regulated by France's electoral law.
 Ballot boxes have been required to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no other envelopes are added than those of registered and authorised voters.
 The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

 According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
 There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
 The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
 She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be tainted because her story has been widely published.
 This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos of suspects.'
 The Crown Office has overall control of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are brought.
 According to sources, the document refers to a settlement, something that the Palestinians have long wanted on the basis of the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
 Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demands that a permanent military presence be maintained in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to accept a presence of five years.
 Shooters in the supplementary test for pest control had to be closely monitored by foresters, as the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
 In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation have had an extensive safety and training instruction.
 Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
 With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP in the past four years, five times.
 Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to hold new elections in the country.
 The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
 The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
 There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents involving the devices.
 Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious."
 'Very regrettable', was the reaction of the ministry about the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
 Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
 The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage across the territory.
 In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
 In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
 With his M16-rifle Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
 Several hostages have been rescued and at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
 Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
 Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet, and Mendoza was eventually shot.
 Liggins went into medicine and followed in his father's footsteps.
 Trained as a midwife, he started working in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While working in the hospital, Liggins did research on premature birth in his spare time.
 His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
 Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
 Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that 'Luna is as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
 Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
 Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal election of 2010 that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34 percent of the participants in this poll stood behind this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
 Twenty-nine percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never happen.
 The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question because of his complaints.
 He could not take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it was banned at the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number on January 25.
 Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
 Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are formed, especially the Earth, since it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
 Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He called the rumors "political nonsense and gossip."
 It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
 The FAA says the NextGen system would allow planes to take shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions.
 It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies using ground-based radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
 No additional transport is provided and no surface trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and P&R are not accessible on site.
 A possible lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
 A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science, was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer because the crossbreeding of a native Darwin finch, the Medium ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Españolaground finch, took longer.
 Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
 It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
 After it has been made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
 This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
 Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
 Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested, the pH value is indicated.
 Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
 Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
 In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
 Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
 Toilets were also used in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. In the Roman era, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women would gather together in a mixed group.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 As soon as the spacecraft receives the call, it immediately sends it back.
 The satellite is shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
 To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
 The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is an easier and faster transport.
 The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
 There are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
 In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) that hunt in larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has, so that they do not compete with others.
 Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
 Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and pups.
 The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
 A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other large cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
 The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
 The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
 A tiger does not roar as loudly as a lion. It is more like a sentence.
 Ocelots' favorite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Ocelots hunt almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than they are.
 Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling the ground where they have been.
 They can see very well in the dark and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
 When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the large population from which it originated (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or by being transported to another island from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
 In this new environment, other raw materials and other enemies appear, so the new population must adapt or adapt to be able to face the competition.
 Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
 As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
 This process is called speciation and simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they take up carbon dioxide that people exhale.
 Through photosynthesis, plants get their nutrients from the sun and also provide shade.
 Our houses and clothes are made from plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time, and had nothing to fear except other Mosasauruses.
 His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which meant that nothing or no one could escape him.
 It is not certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and perhaps even its own species.
 In the water, nothing was safe from his attacks; even huge dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
 Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including boar, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
 In addition, there was a difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during the meal, but rich men liked to hold a banquet together where they lay on their sides during the meal.
 Meals from the Roman era do not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
 For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
 The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own house.
 They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
 Sometimes as part of the temples were built towers in the shape of pyramids called ziggoeratten.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
 The daily life of the Hebrew family took place mostly outside.
 Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and so wood was very expensive.
 Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
 He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
 Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
 After watching the movie National Treasure, you may think that there is a treasure map hidden behind the Declaration of Independence.
 This is a misconception, however. There is indeed something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
 So it seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
 Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, northern France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
 It was ruled by Vichy France, which was a group of French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting them.
 On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France in Operation Dragoon.
 The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then they set off for Germany.
 A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
 From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that defines in a certain way the format of society.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
 When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and are thus not officially recognized as civilizations.
 During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a Congress.
 The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary, and to enforce all its decisions on state authorities, which often refused to cooperate.
 Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
 First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
 Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
 Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest island being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
 Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'.
 The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 In 1624, the Dutch VOC established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, where the VOC took over the indigenous grain production process and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
 After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Composed of three large constructions, the Machu Picchu is made up of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of how they looked before.
 In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
 For example, the most common photographic format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
 These are still produced today, although it is the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor has adopted.
 Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
 The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2.
 Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
 The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
 The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
 In this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
 From the king to the commoner, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
 One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to fight suffering and poverty, and the church has the means to do so.
 The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being upheld.
 Great Britain imposed a blockade on the sea against Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
 The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to supply vital supplies to the military and civilians, but it violated the generally accepted international law that has been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
 Britain laid mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail in large parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
 Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare of the country.
 During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
 After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
 Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
 When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
 Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The best known was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
 At that time, there were fierce wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms period of ancient China is one of the bloodiest in history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the top spot in the great palace in Xi'an.
 The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
 For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
 The same is true for the army. The army ranks are no longer based on a person's class but on the caliber of the person.
 The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
 Muhammad was intensely concerned with spiritual matters. He often went to a cave in the mountains of Noer, which later became known as the Cave of Hira.
 The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
 The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
 Even though it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
 All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, there is very little of this world to see or hear.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
 The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
 The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a dot or a square with the bottom missing.
 Above means that you should start at the tip and push the broom away. Below means that you should start at the bow (the place where your hand holds the broom) and pull the broom.
 An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
 Take the liberty to sketch your personal signs, but don't forget that the printed staff signs are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected most of the time.
 A group of market women sat on October 6, 1789 behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
 They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
 The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
 At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
 The war costs of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines have been paid by the Filipino people.
 They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
 American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous profits of the long exploitation of the Philippines.
 To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
 The period in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
 After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term for a large assortment of ideas in practice: from technological offer or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and the appearance of them in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
 For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
 A national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
 The mass car ownership also causes more accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to be able to repair the human body.
 In Romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, forming a harmonious society and being better than the arbitrary imposed laws.
 Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is today.
 It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
 The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
 Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
 The Gothic period was at its height in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
 Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
 Due to the slow communication channels, however, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
 At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinctive style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
 Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that is usually organic, using saved seed from the ecoregion, and combining it with rotating crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
 In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by mainstream society, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
 A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
 Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
 One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
 They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the parents abandoned the child because they did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
 Troubled children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
 Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
 A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal it has been raised by (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
 Learning by project should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are facing a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or a new project.
 Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is a form of support, but the paperclip man of Microsoft Office is too.
 There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand without help for students.
 There are several reasons that children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
 No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved and where they cannot develop, but it happens.
 We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
 The foster care is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
 In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
 On the Internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
 The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications-theory.
 'Learning' and 'socialisation' are, for example, suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
 Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'continuing relationships' when they investigated audience reactions to Web sites.
 The use of video recordings has led to remarkable findings in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
 It is claimed that no one can detect a lie by only looking at micro-expressions.
 Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately judge its sincerity.
 He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
 Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
 For each generation, there is variation between the two groups by means of separation and recombination.
 A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive in the savannah, but it is difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
 Failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventually even death.
 The easiest to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
 Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
 All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
 Sleep disruption is when you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
 This is quite easy to do by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
 If you set your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means that you have to get up to go to the bathroom.
 The amount of inner calm a person has is in opposition to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
 The less stress, the more positive the life force. Every human being is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
 Everyone can enlighten his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
 Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a following of universal love.
 Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
 The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. With the help of the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
 Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
 The former allies stood two years after the end of the war opposite each other, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
 The war would last 40 years and proxy armies fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
 The Polish defenders held out until 17 September 1939, when they were forced to retreat and reorganize at the bridgehead in Romania.
 These plans were however overtaken in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
 Shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
 Traditionally, it is the job of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is impeded.
 The US tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
 The German Navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time, mainly with U-boats.
 Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
 It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get their hair, meat, milk and skins.
 Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, and were guarded by a goatherd, often a child or young person. This is still the case today.
 As early as the 16th century, horse railways were built in England.
 Although horse-drawn railways were only made of plank rails, the horses had to run faster and pull larger loads than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
 Cross-ties were used quite early to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
 This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
 Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden varieties, and in 1767 the first fully iron rails were laid.
 The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
 Their predecessor, Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
 In fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-armed specializations are found. The Sahelanthropus, moreover, walked seven million years ago probably already on two legs.
 We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate future suffering.
 In many cases, it is like treating the symptoms. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
 The scientific and technological development of human society has obviously changed the earth greatly. In addition, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyle have aggravated the problems.
 After the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away, which was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, and are now better known as "Dunlap broadsides".
 John Nixon first read the document in public on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
 One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy did not survive.
 Many paleontologists believe that dinosaurs still exist today. We call them birds.
 Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But there are many things about birds that still make you think of a dinosaur.
 They have claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
 Manipulating data encoded in binary digits is the basis for almost all computers in use today.
 A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer science 'bits').
 Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
 The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
 Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
 This insect group is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
 This term comes from an ancient agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
 Both red fire ants and bed bugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or house of their host.
 In the US, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
 A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
 These couples may choose to give their baby up for adoption.
 In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
 It is more than just an experiment; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question and to observe, as a guideline for scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts and especially to the Bible in Latin.
 Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
 The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
 In physiological and behavioral rhythm observations, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and the production via the biological clock.
 Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just responses to external periodic signals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle through a certain time period, even if there are no external signals to indicate it.
 The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
 Two experiments were performed: in one experiment the DNA in the phage was labelled with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment the protein of the phage was labelled with radioactive sulphur.
 Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer to develop.
 Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
 On site, one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
 An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the village from which they have just come.
 Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
 Science shows that this enormous carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of the stable state that allowed human evolution to occur over the past two million years.
 Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
 In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
 Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do things go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians just incompetent or is it something more fundamental?
 In traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals are examined.
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively predictable way. This means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to say about this in the field of mathematics.
 The three core characteristics have been linked to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road engineering facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their flying ability, they could more easily escape predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
 The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
 This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
 Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
 A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 There were some people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and the Sun was also revolving (and other stars).
 This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
 The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the next largest.
 The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
 At least 20% of all water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
 The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old.
 There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
 Italian is the official language of the Vatican City.
 Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used during religious ceremonies.
 Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
 Humans have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to extract them with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
 This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they pass into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are simply a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
 Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are of course also metals such as silver and gold.
 Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
 Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit into the tip of this sentence.
 That's why the pencil was a faithful friend for many people when it was launched.
 The pen has unfortunately been lowered in status as newer writing methods have been developed and is used much less.
 Nowadays, we write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
 You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
 The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
 Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
 Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
 The surface of the Moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the Moon.
 The crust is about 70 km thick at the nearest point and 100 km thick at the farthest point.
 The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
 There may be more fissures on the side because the crust is thinner there, allowing lava to rise more easily to the surface.
 Content theories are designed to discover what moves people and what appeals to them.
 This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or wants that are internalized as they grow up.
 With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do certain things or not.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory.
 In general, there are two approaches managers take when they are leading their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to act as equals.
 This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct performance reviews, to delegate and to hold people accountable.
 On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to take ownership of everything.
 Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
 Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are minor differences.
 In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
 They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
 The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
 The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
 Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 Creativity and resourcefulness are revealed when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
 The result of this is that the process of an organization that is working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
 To enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
 According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, which can reduce the research area and collect more accurate data.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists during their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
 As more and more new technologies are developed, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
 This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
 AI conjures up images of science fiction for most people, but it is also a vital part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
 Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is the subject of research in AI.
 Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
 These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
 Nowadays, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
 For each class, many excursions are planned. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
 Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artefacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
 Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital each year, which is redesigned each year and previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
 Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this changes quickly as they have an audience.
 Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and avoid criticism.
 By blogging 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
 When used properly, blogs can help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in the discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
 The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and future.
 Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
 This kind of thing makes Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
 Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
 A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans in the United States than the total population of Canada.
 The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are linked to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, and it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
 The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
 The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel.
 Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
 It also helps to put rings on (not too expensive looking rings).
 Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour that they perceive as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, to be touched on the arm, etc.
 Be clear when you reject a man and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not speak well!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids, and was known as Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed the harbour and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
 The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who settled here gave it the name Casablanca.
 In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
 Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other knick-knacks, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, burying most of the city's streets, and especially the city center, in lava.
 Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the status of the fighting in the province of North Kivu before visiting.
 In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
 With boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) you can move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
 'Timbuktu' is relatively inaccessible and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
 Today, Timbuktu is a depopulated city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
 In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of desert storms.
 It was one of the main stops on the PBS exhibition Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
 The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
 Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs in the east along the border with Mozambique, in the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
 19,500 square kilometres is the size of the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
 As a major tourist attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation levies and entrance fees.
 It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
 The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists as the most important place.
 The large number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a sparkling bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbor.
 The vast majority of the population of Hong Kong Island lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
 This is where the British settlers established themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start here.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Indian and Bangladeshi interior.
 The Sundarbans are now officially included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last mighty tracts of jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
 The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is swamp and marshland.
 The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and are now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
 During the day, buses leave from the border of the districts (opposite the river) from 6.30 to 7.30 am, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
 It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the local buses are often fully booked.
 In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
 Shared taxis can take you quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge crossing the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guiana town of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
 The two towers are 83 meters high. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
 The bridge has a clearance of 15 metres under the bridge. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
 The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, with the Brazilian customs posts expected to be ready for use.
 The Guaraní was the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient agriculture.
 In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
 Paraguay, formerly also called the 'great province of India', was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
 A three-century period of colonization followed under the Spaniards.
 Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
 In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
 Here are also seen smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
 Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is approximately one British pound (GBP).
 On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the shop FIC West. Here you can exchange money.
 In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and American dollars.
 On the remote islands you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
 Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
 Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
 Winter can be deceivingly cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
 Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
 Keep at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals.
 Elk, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them space.
 In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
 The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
 Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain were unable to leave the harbour, later known as the notorious standoff.
 With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
 In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent non-violent meeting in the city.
 There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
 These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
 At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
 These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good offer of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
 'Number One' is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
 There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
 The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easily found if you do not trust it.
 A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
 The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
 Trips to the reef occur year-round and injuries from these trips to the reef are rare.
 Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
 Jellyfish cubes occur from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would actually swim away.
 The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
 Reservations in advance provide peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
 Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, but you can usually also book other accommodation through a travel agency, such as a campsite.
 Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
 They can also hold your reservation if you need a little more time to think about the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
 However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency rather than the hotel.
 For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to secure a camping spot near the music.
 And remember: even if the music on the main stages has finished, there is a chance that there will be music playing on other parts of the festival grounds until late in the evening.
 For families with young children, there are special campsites at some festivals.
 Be careful where you pitch your tent when crossing the Baltic in winter, because the ice makes a tremendous noise if you are too close.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
 Casinos are usually committed to getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
 They normally have special offers in the area of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
 Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment and all experienced gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
 If you go high into the mountains or over mountain passes, you should take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
 On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
 During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a very short period of time, causing a snowstorm.
 The visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
 On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
 The biggest tourist attraction in Africa is safaris, which for many visitors is the highlight of their trip.
 The term safari in popular usage refers to travel over land to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
 If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars, otherwise you will have little chance of seeing them.
 A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walking safari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
 The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be played at other locations in Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice, the first time was in 1964.
 If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
 Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with normal tickets costing around ¥7,000.
 You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available, and you can often borrow these items even if they are not in the room.
 If you do not have an iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
 Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
 You can purify water in a variety of ways. Some methods are effective at addressing specific risks.
 In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas, water must be boiled for several minutes.
 Not every filter is equally effective, so if in doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
 Travellers may encounter animal pests that are not found in their own country.
 Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
 Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people by force, are not considered pests.
 Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duty.
 Travellers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
 Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, you often drive through abandoned backcountry and that makes this route one big challenge.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets and sharp bends.
 The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and adjacent areas — usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it is even more important to stick to them here than elsewhere.
 Surprisingly, you have much more reach here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German pastries taste great and in Bavaria, the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
 You see a lot of fruit cakes. All year round, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
 Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the region.
 To make a curry you need spicy and pungent ingredients, in combination with vegetables or meat.
 Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
 In the interior of northern India and also Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
 Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
 But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
 The cuisine of Java is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, chilies, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
 They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a rider can get stuck in them.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but manages to hang on to the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
 Most riders wear firstly riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
 Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that prevent a stirrup from coming loose if the rider falls off the horse.
 Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile, and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large granite walls and boulders.
 The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have an endless potential.
 Winter sports that involve going downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
 Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
 Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
 The beginning of skiing dates back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
 Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skitouring or ski hiking.
 It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need much sturdier skis and boots for this.
 You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
 In good conditions you can cover greater distances than walking, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for visas several times and undergo passport controls.
 The Schengen area functions in this area almost as one country.
 While you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
 If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
 There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are antiques. Some tax offices give goods that are older than 100 years the definition of antiques.
 The definition may vary from location to location; in North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
 It is possible to classify handicrafts as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
 Reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture of trading is also important for many with other occupations.
 Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They earned their living with fishing, hunting and other activities, and reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
 Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
 The word 'gypsy' is used mostly by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
 If there is a travel advice for the country you want to go to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
 In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
 For example, Americans in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 The opinions only contain a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
 They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture in comparison with other, more detailed sources.
 Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
 Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
 The effects and consequences of severe weather include, for example, strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
 Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
 Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their vicinity may bring, as these may also affect some travel plans.
 Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
 A search for 'courses in hostile environments' on the internet is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
 In a course, all the issues outlined here are usually dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
 A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasionally weapons training.
 There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
 Travellers who have planned a sex change operation abroad should ensure that they have the right documentation for their return journey.
 It varies widely whether governments will issue passports without gender (X) or will update names or gender on documents.
 There is as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
 Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
 Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not come out of this scan with intact privacy and dignity.
 Mudslides are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
 Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
 Most of the deaths are caused by exhaustion as they try to swim against the current, which could be impossible.
 When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
 Try to focus on a place where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
 The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
 Travellers who are easily adaptable to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adapting to their own culture again.
 If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your own customs.
 When you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
 Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
 For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
 You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in all silence before the show starts.
 Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
 The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
 The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids is illuminated.
 The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
 The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
 Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the full-flown crater of an active volcano serving as a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with Bellingshausen Sea.
 Here the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4,892 metres.
 A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
 A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to stand outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
 This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
 Your local phone company can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
 It is becoming increasingly popular for people who plan to travel and learn a year.
 In particular, school leavers use this to take a gap year before university without it affecting their studies.
 Often, a study abroad program during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
 Normally, there is a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
 Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
 A hunt is not necessary for the archipels or lakes.
 The archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
 In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
 The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
 Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St Petersburg (Russia).
 This way you can spend a few full days in the historic town and stay on the ship.
 Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on a boat excursion.
 Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
 It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people have.
 If you know how airplanes work, this can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
 Courier companies are paid a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, purchases or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
 Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
 If they ship things by air, it can take days for them to be unloaded and cleared by customs on some routes.
 Only checked baggage could be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and that is you.
 The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or better still, have your employer pay for it).
 This is not cheap, however: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
 It is usually not worth looking for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know full well that there is a group of flyers who are prepared to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
 Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Here the Romanian language is spoken, but also the Russian language is spoken a lot.
 As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by an ethnic conflict.
 In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
 Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
 Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
 The once ancient city of Izmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
 The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centers covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
 In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique church with eight corners.
 On a number of graves near the church are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
 If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this village.
 In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating place Sintra. Sintra became famous with foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
 Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
 Also go to the north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Marian apparitions took place.
 Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost incomprehensible meaning for a large part of the world population.
 Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
 Show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.
 Do not damage the site by marking or graffiti on the buildings.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
 However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
 In public transport and other facilities, Spanish is often spoken.
 Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are done by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
 Parisians are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
 While this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
 The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
 There are a great many different plant communities, because of the different microclimates, the different types of soil and the varying altitudes.
 This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
 Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie can be found, as well as many other more common species.
 When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt to the knee and their shoulders must be covered.
 Usually you get a wrap as a woman if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own example, with nice screaming colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
 On the other hand, men must wear trousers to at least above the knee.
 You can also borrow these from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in it. One size fits all for men!
 Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil is used extensively.
 A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to flavor, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 Nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
 In this way you make a clear distinction between a number of verbs and nouns.
 It probably makes reading easier, too, but writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
 Most Italian words are spelled exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.
 You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of these depends on the vowel that follows.
 Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means car.
 The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
 Reading this introduction to the grammar will teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you to understand sentences.
 It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
 But people who speak a little Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it separately.
 Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational sites.
 Light pollution was not as big a problem then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are now.
 Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
 Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
 Plants look best in a natural environment, so you have to resist the temptation to remove even 'just one' species.
 When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you are immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available after arrival.
 But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
 There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
 Make sure that the bus you take to Hebron actually goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
 For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
 They also provide popular walking and cycling routes.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
 People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions that are associated with the holiday.
 There is a tradition where you stay up all night until you can see the sunrise.
 Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
 In traditional churches, a vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where the congregation often celebrates at midnight in honor of the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
 Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, and the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos, a variety of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic experience polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
 There is a good chance you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark most of the time.
 The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can enjoy the starry sky.
 The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
 Pakken are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
 Teamwork is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than on rewarding individual performance.
 Employees often need permission from their superiors before they can make a decision and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without question.
