 This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found so often in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
 Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was chestnut and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
 The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
 The feathers of dinosaurs, known as rake, do not have a well-developed shaft, but have other features, such as spines and barbs. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rake was possibly the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a baby.
 The researchers suggested that, despite the tail being from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a down.
 Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

 The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
 The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
 Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
 This theory states that most of the dark matter in the vicinity of a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.

 Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
 He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate", in an interview.
 According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were health care workers.

 In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters seal themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
 After the officials check the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
 French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict manner.
 Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
 Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process, and during the night votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

 Four skiers in the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
 The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
 Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
 The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 The accused appeared in court with his face covered, declared police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
 Although three people were inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them was injured.
 However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
 Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh since then, charged with the murder of her son.
 She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely disseminated.
 This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts consider the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
 Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to go down a dangerous path when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects."
 The Crown Office, which is in charge of the overall prosecution, has told journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
 The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
 Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
 Shooters in the supplemental pest control test were closely supervised by forest engineers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
 In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
 Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
 It is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
 The commission was the response given by Martelly to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
 The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
 About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
 Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
 Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "non-serious."
 The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable."
 The earthquake hit Mariana at 07h19 local time. In GMT time, it was on Friday, at 21h19.
 The office of emergency management of the Northern Marianas said there were no reported damage in the country.
 In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
 A former Filipino policeman hijacked a bus full of tourists in Manila, capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
 Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
 Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
 Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were freed earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
 Then, photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
 He was educated as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 Although he was working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
 His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
 Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first businesswoman. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
 Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as me... or maybe even more... I loved her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
 Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to changing Australia to a republic has risen 8% since 2008.
 Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch of Australia.
 At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
 The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100 and 200 freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
 He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as these are banned in the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number as of Jan. 25.
 Several people have verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
 It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to the Earth along with the organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
 Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He referred to the rumors as "politicking and nonsense"
 He is speculated to run for the presidency in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
 It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
 There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
 The problem of the lack of transport increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
 On Thursday, the magazine Science published a study where it reports the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, in Ecuador.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be worked in any type of form. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
 It is possible to stretch to form a thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or wound into sheets.
 It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
 This is called a chemical PH. You can make a marker using red beet juice.
 Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
 The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical tested.
 Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
 Remaining parts of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
 Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
 The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
 It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
 The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
 We gave you the train, the car and many other forms of transport.
 Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat small animals, far more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that prevents them from competing with each other.
 Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The bands consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
 Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides act in a similar way to wolf or dog packs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
 A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
 The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and cougars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
 The roar of the tiger is not like the all-out roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of words shouted and snarled.
 Jaguarundis like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the jaguarundi hunts are much smaller than it is.
 Scientists believe that jaguarundis follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
 They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguarundis hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
 When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they lived in before.
 This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
 The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
 Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
 We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
 Plants use the sun as their food by means of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
 We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared was other Mosasaurs.
 Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
 We are not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
 It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not stand a chance against it.
 Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called a porcupine.
 Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating.
 Food in ancient Rome did not include foodstuffs originating in America and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
 For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
 The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the home of their respective god.
 People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary in which only priests could enter.
 Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
 Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
 Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open balconies facing the street, and stones were used in the construction of houses.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for murder, sailed west and found Greenland and gave it its name.
 But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
 Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
 If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the great parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
 Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
 The landings and the ensuing battles on D-Day freed northern France, but the south was not yet free.
 It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
 In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
 A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of the society.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization derives from the transfer of knowledge by different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
 Smaller cultures often fade away without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
 During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
 The Congress lacked the power to demand taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
 In addition, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
 The Articles required unanimous consent among all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
 The Italian football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
 Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
 Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
 Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
 The foundation of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing the region named the place Ilha Formosa.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the practices of indigenous grain production and employing Chinese to work on their sugar and rice plantations.
 In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the complex's perimeter have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
 In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
 As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35 mm, which was the size of film that was most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
 It is still produced today, but the most important is that its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
 The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
 The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
 Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or close to this ratio.
 The much abused and often discredited law of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
 According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertical and horizontal (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
 For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite the differences in language and customs.
 All were affected by his influential force, from the king to the peasant.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for this reason.
 The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
 Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
 The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, though the blockade violated internationally accepted regulations laid out in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral-flagged vessels.
 Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
 After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
 He arrived in the United States with no money, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
 In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
 During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
 There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
 Moreover, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
 The same goes for the military, since instead of the ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
 The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
 Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 In fact, it is not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
 There is nothing to see but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
 Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
 The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, has several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
 The "upward-pointing bow" mark has its appearance similar to a V, and the "downward-pointing bow" mark has its appearance similar to a clamp or a square without the bottom side.
 Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the grip (which is the place where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
 In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
 You can write your own notes, but don't forget that the printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
 On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the markets.
 In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
 The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
 At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard in front of the terrified queen.
 The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds with floating rates on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
 Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
 The time when such events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
 The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a number of ideas in practice, from the offer of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first, is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second, is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
 For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
 However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
 The possession of cars in mass leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal the injured bodies.
 Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 Geography, in the context of Romanticism, shaped citizens and, over time, customs and culture emerged linked to that geography, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that were eventually mandatory.
 Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
 Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
 It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris occurred.
 The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
 In the beginning, the clothing was very influenced by the Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
 However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may be 25 to 30 years behind.
 By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their garments.
 Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of food sufficient to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses native seed stocks from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
 Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by mainstream society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
 The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
 One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
 These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of his or her severe intellectual or physical disability.
 Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
 Other species are supposed to have been created by animals; some are said to have lived by themselves in the jungle.
 When fully raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
 While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
 Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, as well as that little talking clip of Microsoft Office.
 The virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software with the purpose of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
 Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
 No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for and educate, but it does.
 We see the Family Hosting System as a safe zone for these children.
 Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
 It is assumed that foster care meets all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
 The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
 For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
 “Personal involvement” and “relationships with continuity” were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public’s reactions to web pages.
 The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
 Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, despite this, able to assess sincerity accurately.
 He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
 Twentieth century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
 The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
 Segregation and recombination mixes variation between the two bases with each generation.
 In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available vegetable resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
 In addition, not acting according to it generates serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The most readily available plant-based foods would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
 However, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in large quantities that contain all essential amino acids.
 Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep interruption is a process that consists of waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again soon after (10–60 minutes).
 This can be easily done by using a quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up completely.
 If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as this forces the person to get up to urinate.
 The level of inner peace of a person correlates inversely to his level of bodily and spiritual tension.
 The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
 Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
 With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
 Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, system shocks, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
 Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
 The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
 On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
 The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
 The work of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to displace people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of their enemies to move their own people and goods.
 One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
 If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have the ability to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
 It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them in order to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
 Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pasture areas, often tended by children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
 Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
 Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads on the slightly rougher roads.
 Dormentes were implemented early on, to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
 This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
 The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
 His predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
 Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
 We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
 This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the origin of the problems and end them.
 It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advancements of the human race, and problems have become bigger because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
 After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to a printing shop owned by John Dunlap.
 During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
 The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
 On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original hand-copied version did not survive.
 Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
 Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
 They have scales on their feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-rex.
 Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
 Internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
 The biggest clue to internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
 Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
 The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
 This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are quite structured insects to stick to humans.
 Both barbers and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 The research showed that women have twice the chances of having multiple sclerosis than men.
 A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their interest, or in their child's interest.
 Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
 The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
 It is not, in fact, only experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, ask questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
 All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
 As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Several rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are usually fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interference of the environment.
 The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the major indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase use phage, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
 They did two experiments that either marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
 Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
 Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, watching birds, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
 An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns of the interior, to go to work in other cities, and come across other people who work just in those small towns from which they left.
 In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a system of transport based on private cars.
 Science now points to the fact that this carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
 Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
 In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
 Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
 Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
 Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
 To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
 Such relations assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to go airborne. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
 This gives them a greater range of small places to hide from predators.
 Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and ephemerals.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
 Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
 That sounds sensible, because the planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
 The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest in the world. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes with nearly 10 km of width.
 A total of 20% of the water that goes from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
 The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, who had been dead for over a thousand years.
 The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
 The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
 Italian is also the common language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
 Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
 This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
 You can also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
 All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible to fit trillions of them into the period at the end of this sentence.
 Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was launched.
 Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
 Nowadays, people write messages through computer screens and do not need to get close to a pointer.
 We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes out.
 The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
 It's more or less like walking with a heavy cart up a hill. The division of the nucleus again releases some of this energy.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little or no incentive.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
 The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
 There may be more magma on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they reach adulthood.
 These theories look at what is in certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general terms, two conducts may surface as managers begin to lead their former co-workers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain as "one of the guys" (or girls).
 This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an impossible to recognize individual who feels that he must change everything that the team has done and do his own.
 After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
 This behavior often ends up in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
 Virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
 The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
 Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
 As a result, the process of a team working together to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
 Before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performances.
 Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, therefore narrowing the research area and making it much more accurate.
 The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
 It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
 The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
 This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our mind.
 Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
 AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
 Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnoses, as well as recognition of writing, voice and speech.
 These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
 AI system is often used in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it is integrated into various software applications of home computers and video games.
 Field trips are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
 Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see pieces of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
 Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year, the site is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a book of memories.
 Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Since students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience often changes that.
 Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
 In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the public inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
 The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with the contents of the Internet in an active way, students can position themselves in the context of the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the Canadian past and present.
 Niagara Falls are further south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
 Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what people from outside consider the essence of Canada.
 Large areas further north are also sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited.
 For comparison of the population that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
 The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the East African coast.
 Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent by itself, when it comes to wildlife.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
 The Arabs also brought to the lands Islam, which gained a lot of popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
 European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
 In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 Women: It is recommended that all travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
 Women should understand that cultural differences may cause acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Be firm in refusing men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether it's cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it with the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
 The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which received the name of Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
 Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
 Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, narguilés and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
 While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
 The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.
 You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
 "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for distant and exotic lands, given its relative inaccessibility.
 Today, Timbuktu is a depleted city despite its reputation for making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
 In 1990, it was placed on the list of humanity's heritage in danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
 It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on the PBS channel.
 The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arabic than African touch.
 Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
 The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different animal species.
 It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
 There are entrance and conservation fees for the park, as is the case with all South African national parks.
 It can also be very useful to get a Wild Card. With it you can have access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
 The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as its main attraction.
 The parade of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glowing bar graph that is visible for the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
 Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
 This is the place that the British settlers chose to live, and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
 Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
 The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
 But the forests are not only home to mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
 The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
 Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
 There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
 As the inter-district buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
 Most districts are served by Japanese coastal microbuses, which are comfortable and durable.
 Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
 The Oiapoque Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to link the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
 The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, have 378 meters in length and two runways of 3.50 m wide.
 The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
 The bridge is scheduled to enter into operation in September 2017, the date scheduled for the completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
 The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
 In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
 The Spaniards started the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
 Since the creation of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in maintaining many of its characteristics and identity of the indigenous peoples.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
 The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
 Tournaments and minor matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
 To find out about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
 The official currency of Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
 The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
 On remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Please enquire with the owners in advance to find out what method of payment they accept.
 It is virtually impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
 As Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
 Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
 There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
 Although many of the animals in the park are used to human presence, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
 Following the instructions of park officials, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
 Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't get too close.
 Moreover, know that odors attract bears and other wild animals, however, avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smell and keep the camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The port was the scene of a well-known naval stand-off in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA and Britain refused to leave.
 All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 lives of Germans and Americans were lost.
 During the Mau independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
 There are many beaches, as Auckland is between two bays. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
 The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
 These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is safe.
 The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a sophisticated beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
 There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can come down better.
 Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
 For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange; a short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
 Hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but great.
 Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, occurring on the reef, are rare.
 Continue to heed the warnings of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay close attention to the security alerts.
 The box jellyfish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
 Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
 Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
 Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is likely that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, through a travel agent.
 Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotels.
 They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
 However, if you have any changes or requests, these must first be forwarded to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
 At some music festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most of them consider it a key part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to get there early to be able to camp near the music.
 Remember that even after the end of the music on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing until late.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because when crossing the ice a terrible noise is generated for the most sensitive.
 St. Petersburg cruises include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
 Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
 They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
 Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping sober.
 Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over the mountains, they should take into account the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
 On ice and snow roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as if you were on a clean asphalt.
 During snowstorms, it is possible to get enough snow to leave you stranded in a very short time.
 Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
 On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
 Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the eye candy of many visitors.
 The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to overland trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars, and the basic equipment allows for good viewing.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
 Also known as "walking safari", "walking safari" or "passada", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
 The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
 If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
 It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
 Hanging wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for loan, even if there is none in the room.
 If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to use worn-out socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
 Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
 There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
 In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are required.
 The quality of filters varies and if you are in doubt, it may be a good idea to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
 Travellers may encounter pests with which they are not familiar in the regions from which they come.
 Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
 Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, do not usually qualify as pests.
 Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of taxes and fees in certain locations.
 Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
 The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often pass through isolated prairie areas.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp bends are common.
 The posted speed limits are visibly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
 Curiously, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, are very well made and varied, similar to those of the neighboring south, Austria.
 Fruit-based sweets are recurrent, with apples baked into sweets all year round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
 Many German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want some small, but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
 A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
 A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
 In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
 With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a wide-ranging mix of regional cooking styles found throughout the country.
 But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally is from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply spiced dishes, the predominant Javanese spices being peanuts, chilies, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 In order for a rider's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
 They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety issues as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot still caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
 First, a large part of the pilots wears riding boots with heel and flat sole, which is quite narrow.
 Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
 Being the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
 The meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Alpinists from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among their infinite potential of walls.
 Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
 Skiing is an important activity on a trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
 The idea of skiing is very old—paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.!
 Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century at the earliest, and in 1861 the first recreational ski team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
 Ski backpacking: activity also known as sertão skiing, touring skiing or ski-alpinism.
 It is related, but usually does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
 Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
 In good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than on foot - but only very rarely can you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
 Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries, and in normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
 The Schengen zone, however, functions as a country in this respect.
 If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
 Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
 There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
 The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
 Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
 Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is important to many other classes of professionals as well.
 Even though it is a tradition, not all Sami participated in the creation of reindeer on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and things of that kind, having the reindeer as, mainly, draft animals.
 Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
 Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
 If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 It is also recommended that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is made for their respective citizens.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
 The views presented are usually superficial, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
 Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
 Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographical location, topography and weather conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as well as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
 Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowstorms, as well as snow, ice and dust storms.
 Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their region, as this can affect travel plans.
 When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person should first receive professional training.
 A search on the Internet for 'Hostile environment course' will usually give the address of a company in the area.
 A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
 A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, various first aid and, sometimes, training with weapons.
 Books and magazines dealing with survival in the jungle are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
 Travelers planning to have sex-change surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
 The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender undefined (X), or updated documents to find a name and a desired gender, varies.
 The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
 Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
 Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not have to expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
 Returning currents are the reflux of the water of the waves on the beach back to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
 Due to the sub-aquatic topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid current can form for deep water there.
 Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
 Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than it would be normally.
 Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been detected, wait for rescue.
 The re-entry shock occurs before the cultural shock (it takes less honeymoon time), lasts longer and can be more severe.
 Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
 When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
 When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
 People don't realize that patience and understanding are also key for travelers returning home.
 In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the show of lights and sounds of the pyramid.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in silence before the show starts.
 Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of the sound and light is like a book of stories.
 The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
 The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are lit up.
 The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active until 2020.
 The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
 The others are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the flooded crater of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The peninsula's mountains here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360-km chain of Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892 m (16,050 ft) on Mount Vinson.
 In remote locations with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
 A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
 The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
 Your local telephone company may be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
 One increasingly popular option for those who want to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
 This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
 In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
 Usually, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
 For those who like boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the “Land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands.
 In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
 Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
 Boating with a boat is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
 This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
 Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship for the night.
 If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
 Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on the brochure. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people have not flown before or have never been through a traumatic event.
 It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
 For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
 Transport companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
 On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
 If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to get to the port and pass through customs.
 The only way to get through faster was to send as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
 The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
 However, it is not cheap: as a basic rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
 In general terms, it is not worth even looking for discounts on seats for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
 In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
 Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
 The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
 Once the ancient city of Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
 The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and the old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than classic Turkey.
 The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
 In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on tombs of people.
 It is worth walking half an hour through the intriguing village.
 To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after an exuberant report of its splendor made by Lord Byron.
 The Scotturb Bus 403 travels to Sintra frequently, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
 Also to the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Relicario), a place famous worldwide for Marian apparitions.
 Recall that you are basically making a visit to a huge cemetery, also as a place that has a practically incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
 There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here and many others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there.
 Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
 Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
 However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as the official language.
 Still, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
 Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
 Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make your trip considerably easier.
 The brusque exterior of the Parisian will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies.
 Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly forested, mainly with beech, fir, and pine, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
 The area also houses a large variety of animal and bird species.
 Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and tetrazes, as well as several other common species.
 While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
 Most monasteries provide robes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own robes, especially bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun.
 Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
 It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there is a single size!
 Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
 A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any ingredient at hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
 This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
 This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used in the substantivized form.
 Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
 The main letters to be observed are the C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel that follows.
 Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
 The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
 Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the sentences.
 Needless to say, if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
 However, people who speak a little Spanish may conclude hastily that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study separately.
 Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today and remain in museums or schools.
 As light pollution in their heyday was not a problem, they tend to be found in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built more recently.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
 The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
 The concept came from China, where the peach blossom was the favorite flower.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
 Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" weed.
 If you visit a formal garden, picking "specimens" will also get you kicked out, without a right to discussion.
 Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
 But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll need to deal with both the heat (constant) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
 There are also some buses going north to Hebron, traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
 Check to see if the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby town of Kiryat Arba.
 The inland waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
 For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to the sights of the Danube or sail the Erie Canal.
 They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
 Many of the holiday's traditions have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
 There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere open to see the sunrise.
 There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
 Most traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
 Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
 Since the arrival of humans in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
 This is a great opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark enough at the right time.
 As the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
 In Japan, workplace cultural relationships are more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to seeing.
 Suits are the standard business attire, and co-workers refer to each other by their last names or job titles.
 Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than touting individual achievements.
 Workers generally need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
