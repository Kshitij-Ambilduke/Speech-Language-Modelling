 This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that can’t usually be gleaned from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
 Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were above a chestnut-brown color, and below - either pale, or had carotenoid pigmentation.
 The find also allows to get acquainted with the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Since the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and whiskers - the researchers concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later by the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents adult plumage, not chick down.
 The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult individual, and not the down of a chicken.

 They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
 The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the number of Rossby waves in the star's plasma flow.
 The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field reversals.

 The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
 The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
 Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as it affects ordinary matter.
 According to this theory, a significant part of the dark matter around the Galaxy is in the form of an halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

 In the course of research in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Tony Moll (Tony Moll) managed to find tuberculosis with exceptionally high resistance to drugs (XDR-TB).
 In an interview, he said the new strain "raises very big concerns because it leads to very high mortality".
 Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers at the hospital.
 In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people in close contact.

 In France, voting is traditionally carried out using low-tech methods: the voter closes himself in a booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the candidate he has chosen into an envelope.
 After the officials verify the voter's identity, he drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
 French election laws are quite strict in their procedures.
 Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no other envelopes have been added except those of those who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
 Candidates can send their representatives to follow the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

 In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Diengi Dani.
 Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish.
 The police of Madhya Pradesh returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
 Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and have returned her mobile phone and laptop."
 The accused have names Babu Kandjar, Bhuta Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar and Vishnu Kandjar.
 Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
 Although there were three people inside the building at the time the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
 However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
 He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoye with the murder of her son.
 She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony she gives could be tainted because her popularity has been widely exploited by the media.
 This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts found the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists do seem to be treading a dangerous line in publishing photographs and other details of suspects."
 The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecuting, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a verdict is handed down.
 The document, according to the leak, will deal with the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
 Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan River valley.
 Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to a five-year presence.
 The guards who participated in the additional test for pests had to be under the close supervision of rangers, as this test was observed and evaluated.
 As part of the partnership between NPWS and the NSW Sporting Shooters Association, a hunting program was run by the Sporting Shooters Association to recruit qualified volunteers.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation parks and heritage of the Wildlife and National Parks Service, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent a comprehensive training and safety briefing.
 Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
 This is the fifth CEP Martini in four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous interim electoral council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
 The commission was Marcellus's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
 These sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to be held as early as 2011.
 About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPod devices have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving the devices.
 Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
 In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting the issue "very regrettable."
 At 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) there was an earthquake in Mariana.
 The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
 A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
 Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
 Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
 Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were freed earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
 Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman, as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
 Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
 He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to investigate cases of premature births.
 His study showed that if you introduce the hormone, it will enhance the maturation of the lungs of the child during the period of fetal development.
 According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes."
 Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the moon.
 Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of the two moons. It's such a unique event, as she was. A strong woman."
 Dustin "Goldust" Runnells said, "The moon was as sick as I was... maybe even more sick... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
 Of 1,400 people surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
 Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34% of those surveyed agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
 The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt after he complained of illness.
 He was unable to take the painkillers he needed because they are banned in the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 opened the largest prime number known to date.
 On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed this discovery using different hardware and software.
 Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets have been colliding with Earth for a long time.
 Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
 He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense."
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly more direct routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
 It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
 No additional transport will be brought to Wembley, there will be no stopping of ground trains, and there will be no parking lots and parking lots on the surface.
 Fears over transportation have prompted speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
 The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
 Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the transplanted cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
 Gold can be given any shape. It can be cast into very small shapes.
 It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be woven and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into coils.
 It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "illuminated manuscript".
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with the juice of a red cabbage.
 Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
 The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under investigation.
 Hydrogen ions are protons, from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
 Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then with clean wet hands, form a ball from this mixture.
 The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
 Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a flush, connected to a complex sewage system.
 Remaining fragments of sewage systems were discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
 When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
 The satellite was delivered to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
 To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall.
 The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
 It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other vehicles.
 Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, many small cats (including stray house cats) eat and hunt much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success lies in the concept of niche, a special job that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
 Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The pride consists of one to three adult males related to each other, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach thirty.
 Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides behave very much like wolf packs or dog packs — animals that, in behavior, are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and also very dangerous to their prey.
 Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
 The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
 A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a string of disjointed words.
 Ocelots love to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
 Scientists believe that cats follow the trail of animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
 They are able to see very well in the dark with night vision and move almost unnoticed, stalking their prey and then pouncing on it.
 When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
 This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
 The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
 Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
 We call this process speciation, the origin of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of, and a crucial part of, evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
 Plants feed from the sun with the help of photosynthesis. In addition, they throw a shadow.
 We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
 His long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and he had an extra row of teeth on his palate, so that anyone who crossed his path was doomed.
 We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was forked. He ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
 It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would not have been a match for it.
 Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange and unusual dishes, served at feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a hedgehog.
 There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have joint feasts, during which they ate lying on their sides.
 The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
 In particular, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman has not tried turkey.
 The Babylonians built each of the gods a main sanctuary, which was considered the god's home.
 People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' wishes in ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
 Sometimes as elements of the temple were built special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurats".
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
 Much of the Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
 Women prepared in the yard; the shops were open counters, which opened onto the street. For the construction of houses used stone.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
 But regardless of his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
 Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence had a map of treasures on the back.
 However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence it says: "The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written upside down and back to front.
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for easier storage.
 So it is quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
 As a result of Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was not.
 It was under the control of the "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
 In just 2 weeks, the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
 Civilization is a separate culture, the bearers of which is a fairly large group of people living and working together, society.
 The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in some way.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural presence and a transmissible spread.
 Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
 During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
 Congress had no taxing powers, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and refused to enforce its acts.
 He also had no authority to repeal state tax laws and rates.
 To amend the articles, unanimous approval of all states is required, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
 The Italian football team, along with the German, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and "Formula One" motor racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. The inhabitants of these regions of Italy participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
 Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
 Due to its belonging to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
 Taiwan originated many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous methods of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they looked originally.
 By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the most common format for still photographs in the world is 35 mm, and it was this size that was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog era.
 It is still produced today, but more importantly, it has inherited the aspect ratio of digital camera images.
 The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
 The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
 Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are equal to or close to these proportions.
 Too often used and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
 It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, was the object of close scrutiny.
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
 Her all-pervasive power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist for this purpose.
 The center of church authority was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine was being observed.
 Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
 This strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated universally accepted international laws set out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
 Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
 As the response to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 Among most citizens and nations in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
 Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
 He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
 In ancient China, a unique way of designating periods of time was used; each period of China or each family that was in power was a particular dynasty.
 In addition, between the reigns of each dynasty there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
 During this period there were fierce military actions between many noble people fighting for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
 There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
 Also after the Revolution opened up opportunities for work were opened to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
 The same applies to the army, because ranks were based on merit, not on birth.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for reflection.
 And the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
 The cave is located on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 It is very difficult to find even for those who know about its existence, because the cave is in complete isolation.
 There is nothing but the pure beauty of the sky above and the surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
 The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
 The sign of the movement of the V-shaped looks like a V, and the movement of the V-shaped looks like a hook or a square without a bottom side.
 "Up" means you should start at the tip and pull the bow up, and "down" means you should start where your hand holds the bow and pull it down.
 The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more forceful sound.
 You can draw your own staves, but remember that the staves are printed for musical reasons, and should usually be followed.
 On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
 They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
 The crowd of people made the King and Queen open the windows wide.
 At one point, one member of the crowd waved a royal guardsman's head, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
 The military expenditures of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bond issues moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
 Of course, the superprofits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main source of income of American imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted their creation.
 The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
 The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to a strict point of view that the fate of people is driven by the fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
 Most views of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually impervious to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
 For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
 However, a nationwide road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
 Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating the resulting injuries in healthcare.
 Romanticism in many ways included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture arose that, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
 Just as Paris is called the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
 Fame about it as a center of luxury went about 400 AD and continued approximately to 1100 AD.
 Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with such prized goods as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
 It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
 At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
 However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag 25-30 years behind.
 Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
 Natural farming is farming that is done for the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
 Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses seeds from plants that grow in the ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
 Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel alienated by society's standards and allow such people to define themselves.
 Subcultures may differ in terms of age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people who make up the subculture.
 The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of a subculture often declare their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
 One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse, did not have contact with adults during their development.
 Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such rejection of their child was the result of the parents' rejection of his or her serious intellectual or physical disability.
 Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of abuse or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
 Others, it is claimed, were reared by animals; some of them lived in the wild by themselves.
 If he is fully raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child demonstrates behaviors (within physical limitations) almost identical to the particular animal that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
 While project-based learning should be easier and more engaging, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
 Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance to those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Skaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Screwyp in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual scaffolding, which helps in training, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the trainee might find too difficult to handle alone.
 Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons, from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
 Children should not grow up in an environment where education, care and education are not provided, but grow up.
 We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
 Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
 Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
 The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
 The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach and satisfaction.
 Thus, the idea that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)
 "Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also named by Eimmi and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
 The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his micro-expressions.
 In the article "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
 According to his assumption, such abilities to interpret human behavior can have animals, for example, domestic dogs.
 Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
 Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection eliminates it from the set of manifest variations.
 Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffles the variations between the two pools.
 In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like ours have difficulty meeting their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
 Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as slow growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates such as ourselves if not cooked.
 On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
 Given all this, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
 Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking during normal sleep and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10–60 minutes).
 This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
 If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, then you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of liquid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
 The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
 The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present in you. Every human being is potentially given the opportunity to find absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
 Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
 The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-consuming love.
 The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of Deities. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the mind is enlightened.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war, disagreements regarding the system, process and culture led to discord between the countries.
 Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
 It was to last the next 40 years. It was fought for real, using proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places around the world.
 By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the seizure of eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
 The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
 The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, and to simultaneously prevent an enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
 One of the most notable recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to ferry people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
 If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
 Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves to have milk, wool, meat and fur.
 Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, which were often watched over by children or teenagers, a practice that is still common today.
 Roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
 Although the log roads were merely parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than the slightly more rutted roads of the time.
 Gaps were used quite a long time ago to keep the rails in place, but it became clear later that the tracks were more effective with an iron plate on top.
 This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
 Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
 The first known form of transportation was walking, people began to walk straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means straight man).
 For their australopithecine ancestors, bipedalism was not so common.
 Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although perhaps Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
 We can start living more environmentally friendly. We can become members of the environmental movement and even activists to alleviate the further suffering.
 As a rule, it is like treating the symptoms. If we need not just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
 It is obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of scientific and technological progress of mankind, and because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people, the problems have become more serious.
 After the Congress's adoption on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to printer John Dunlap.
 150–200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
 The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
 On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
 The 25 known Donnelly leaflets are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
 Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs survived and lived to our days. We call them birds.
 They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
 But there is still much to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
 They have claws and teeth, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
 Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" —  or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
 It may be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make a quick diagnosis.
 The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
 Read the label for specific instructions on first aid for this particular poison.
 The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to the group of insects.
 This concept comes from the bed bugs, insects that have been known since ancient times and are well adapted to parasitize on humans.
 Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
 In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are diagnosed, making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged adults.
 Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Studies have shown that multiple sclerosis affects twice as many women as men.
 A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
 These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
 When a child is adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
 The main goal of science is to find out how the world is put together using the scientific method. This method is actually the basis of most scientific research.
 He, however, is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
 In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were adopted.
 As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
 Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cycling over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
 The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium with the help of phages, i.e. viruses.
 They conducted two experiments, labeling radioactive phosphorus DNA phage and radioactive phage protein.
 Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected stretch of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
 Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to the next generation, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
 Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
 Among the examples of active recreation at the facility are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
 An example is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and pass by those whose place of work is in the place from which they have just left.
 In this active traffic movement, everyone is in some way connected to and supports the personal car-based transportation system.
 Science now indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
 Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Virtually everyone complains about these systems.
 In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or falling bridges.
 Why do transportation systems receive so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
 The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because it is not possible to predict the behavior of the driver with 100% probability.
 Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often systematic enough; thus, traffic flows as a whole have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
 To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between three main variables were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape predators, find food and find mates.
 Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
 This provides them with more hiding places in which to hide from predators.
 Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 Many believed him to be right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
 This seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
 The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that sometimes reaches six miles.
 As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
 The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
 Although the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza was never surpassed.
 In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
 The Vatican City State has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
 The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
 Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
 Humans have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 They were like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, though he also suggested that they transitioned into a new state to make what we see.
 Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
 It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
 Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it appeared.
 It is sad that when new writing methods appeared, the pencil lost its former status and was used less.
 Now people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a typewriter.
 One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of more new technologies.
 The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is needed.
 It's like pushing a heavy wheelbarrow uphill. Then the re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no outside influence.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
 It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
 The visible side may have more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there, so lava was easier to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that build up inside them as they grow up.
 These theories address what causes particular people to want to do what they do, and what their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
 Two popular theories about content are Maslow's "Needs Pyramid" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation."
 Typically, there are two types of behaviors when managers begin to manage people who were previously their peers. One extreme is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or "one of the gals").
 Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary measures, to evaluate the results of work, to distribute responsibilities and to hold employees accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the team did and take it for himself.
 After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some small differences.
 Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
 They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
 The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the team of managers, to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets the norms for each participant.
 Why would an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves.
 In the end, the concerted efforts of the organization to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the interests of the client.
 Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
 The data of neuroscience give physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
 The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
 The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
 This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
 Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important direction of computer science, which considers the behavior and training of machines and "imprinting" them with intelligence.
 AI research includes the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and creation of schedules, reaction to diagnoses and questions of the client, as well as recognition of the face, handwriting and voice.
 Such questions are singled out into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
 Nowadays, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
 Field trips are very important for any class. Very often teachers want to take their students to places that can not be reached by bus.
 Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art, all while sitting with their class.
 Posting a tour to the virtual space for all to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
 For example, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital each year, and each year the site is updated, but access to the old versions is still preserved - they serve as a memory album.
 Blogs can also improve writing skills in students. Although students often start their blog using shoddy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
 Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for improvement of his writing in order to avoid criticism.
 Also, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a collaborative tool and it motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
 Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' work, as well as articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is a lovely bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that open the past and present of Canada.
 Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the domain of unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
 All this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
 Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 An amazing population comparison: there are more African Americans in the US than there are citizens in Canada.
 The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is much larger than any other and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
 Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially it took root on the Comoros and Mayotte.
 The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a route through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
 In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 For women: All tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It is also useful to wear a ring (but not too expensive looking).
 Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel harassed, followed, grabbed, and so on.
 Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and the Merinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Caz-Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
 The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed-Dar-el-Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
 Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
 Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole assortment of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
 In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
 Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to check in advance about any trips outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
 This city is also the starting point for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo, and here you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
 You can go to Goma by bodaboda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
 Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for the exotic farthest reaches of the earth.
 Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
 In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the danger from the sands of the desert.
 During the filming of Henry Louis Gates's PBS series "The African World" one of the most important stops was made here.
 This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic rather than African.
 Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
 The park area is 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
 It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the leading among South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As in all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation fee for the park and for visiting it.
 It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit the national parks of South Africa either selectively or all.
 The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main object of their attention.
 A string of buildings forming the line of Hong Kong's horizon is compared to a glittering bar chart, emphasized by the water of Victoria Bay.
 To see the most picturesque places of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and go to the coast of the peninsula of Chu Lung, which is located opposite.
 The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is closely concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
 This is the place the British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
 Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching from the shore 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India.
 Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remaining great jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plains.
 Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq km, of which about one-third is covered by water or swamp.
 Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and, according to estimates, there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer on its territory.
 Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakarta/Bandung, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
 Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most areas are served by small Japanese buses Coaster, convenient and reliable.
 The minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
 These two towers reach 83 meters in height, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
 The height of the substructure is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
 According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
 The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that is now eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region served as home to different groups of local tribes, for example the Guaycuru and the Payaaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
 In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was then called the "great province of the East Indies", emerged as a result of the clash between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
 The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
 Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
 The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
 Less major tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year too.
 To find out about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
 As a rule, British pounds will be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
 On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify with the owners in advance what method of payment is acceptable.
 Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside of the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
 Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30 ° C are common.
 Winters can be deceivingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a colder-feeling weather than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same all year round.
 Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so do not feed or disturb the animals.
 The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves within 100 yards/meters, and all other wildlife within 25 yards/meters.
 No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can attack.
 Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
 Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food with you, and keep your camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
 All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
 During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Leao Tong.
 There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore (in the area of North Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees such as the pohutukawa.
 In the central area of Auckland, where the Waitemata Harbour is located the prestigious suburbs of Mt Eden and St Heliers, the Tamaki Drive beaches are spread.
 These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good choice of shops along the shore, and swimming is safe.
 The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
 There are many French wines that can be drunk, however New Zealand and Australian wines can be transported better.
 Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is not difficult to find bottled water.
 Australians do not understand the idea of "flat white". "Little black" is espresso, cappuccino they serve with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea without milk.
 Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
 The reef is visited by a large number of trips throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
 Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
 Cubomedusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, and sometimes outside this period.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
 Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
 Advance booking allows the traveler to not worry about where to stay upon arrival at the destination.
 Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
 Travel agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages that include flights and hotel accommodation.
 They can also hold the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (for example, a visa).
 Any changes or requests must be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
 At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees sleep on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
 If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
 Remember that even if the music on the main stages has finished, there may be areas on the festival where the music will continue until late at night.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as the passage through the ice leads to a rather scary noise that can disturb the most sensitive people.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
 Casinos usually make every effort to keep visitors inside as long as possible and spend as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows and clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
 They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and prevent them from leaving.
 Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
 Anyone planning to travel in high-altitude areas or mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
 On the icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you can not drive the car as on the usual asphalt.
 During a blizzard, enough snow to cause a traffic jam can fall in a very short period of time.
 Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, sleet, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
 On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries and road traffic continues throughout the year almost without interruption.
 Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
 The term safari in everyday use means a land trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
 Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so even with regular equipment you can get a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better through binoculars.
 A walking safari (also called a "bushwalking safari", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is a walking tour of several hours to several days.
 The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
 If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
 Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
 Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels rent an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
 If you don't have an iron or you're not keen on the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if you have one.
 Do not expose the fabric to too high temperatures (which can cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burns).
 There are different ways to clean water, some of them more effective against specific threats.
 In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it will take a few minutes.
 Filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubt you should consider buying water in sealed bottles and from a reputable company.
 Travelers may encounter pests they haven't seen in their home countries.
 Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infections.
 Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause damage or death to humans are not generally considered pests.
 Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain points without taxes and excise duties.
 Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
 The stretch between Point Marion and Fermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated, hilly, and wooded terrain.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on the lookout: there are steep slopes, narrow alleys and sharp turns.
 The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
 However, oddly enough, mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German baked goods are quite good. In Bavaria they are plentiful and varied and resemble the baked goods of their southern neighbor, Austria.
 Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are available all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.

 Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to refer to the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 But without qualification, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 The Javanese cuisine, nowadays widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of unpretentious dishes. The Javanese prefer such flavouring additives as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang from both sides of the saddle.
 They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a risk of foot entrapment.
 If the horse has thrown the rider but his leg is caught in the stirrup, the running horse may drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
 First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and rather thin sole.
 In addition, individual saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with protective arcs, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
 Coyamó Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering, it is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and cliffs.

 Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
 Cross-country skiingThis activity is also called backcountry, skituro or hiking on skis.
 This involves, but usually does not include, hiking to the summit and then skiing down unprepared slopes, as skiing down the face requires stiffer skis and boots.
 Imagine that the ski trail is a hiking trail.
 Under good conditions, you can cover several more kilometers than when walking, but such speed on skis you can develop only in very rare cases when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a groomed ski trail.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent states on it, and in ordinary circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control many times.
 But the Schengen area in this respect functions as a single country.
 While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
 Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money and avoid paperwork.
 There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
 This concept has geographical variants in which the age limit in places like North America may be less than in Europe.
 Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
 Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the surrounding culture is also important for many other professions.
 Although this is the tradition, not all representatives of the Saami people engaged in mass breeding of reindeer; they lived fishing, hunting and other similar fisheries, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
 Today many Saami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Saami region of Lapland.

 The course usually covers much more in-depth all the topics covered here, often with practical training.
 The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a large amount of first aid information and sometimes weapons training.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are not many publications about war zones.
 People planning to have sex-change surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.

 Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the scanners and have their privacy and dignity respected.
 Backwash — a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes a reef or something similar.
 The reverse flow is concentrated in a few deeper locations where rapid currents may form, descending to greater depths, due to this subsurface topography.
 Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
 Once you get out of the current, swimming back will not be harder than usual.
 Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you were seen, you may want to wait for rescue.
 Culture shock upon returning to one's home country comes earlier than cultural shock (here a shorter, more romantic period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
 Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their own culture.
 When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
 When you first went abroad, people were likely to treat you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
 It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
 The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
 The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.

 The land of Elsworth is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the sea of Bellingshausen.
 The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again and form a 360-kilometer mountain system Elsuert, divided by the Minnesota glacier into two parts.
 In the northern part, that is, on the ridge of the Sentinele, are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the massif of Vinson, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
 In remote places outside the mobile phone coverage area, a satellite phone may be your only option.
 A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be in the open air in a direct line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
 The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communications.
 As a rule, you will be able to get additional information about the connection of this service, contacting your local telephone operator.
 An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
 This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
 In many cases, taking a course abroad during an academic break can indeed boost your chances of getting into higher education at home.
 As a rule, when entering such educational programs, a fee for training is charged.
 Finland is an excellent place for boating. In the "land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the archipelagos.
 Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
 While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave completely different impressions.
 Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
 A similar situation is in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value is from one to forty).
 Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Russia's St. Petersburg.
 This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, and sleep on the ship.
 If you go to the shore only in the order of excursion on the ship, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
 Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
 Flying by plane can be frightening for anyone of any age or social status, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.

 Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help to overcome the fear that comes from not knowing or being unable to control the process.
 Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often the speed of delivery of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair is very important.
 Some of the larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
 If they were sending anything as air cargo, then on some routes the unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
 The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, so you need to be involved.
 The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for you).
 However, it is not cheap - by experience, in a rough approximation, you will pay  four times more than the usual economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
 As a rule, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

 Since light pollution was not as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to get to than those built in our time.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 The contemplation of the cherry blossom, called "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the color of the plum.
 In Japan, the first celebrations of the sakura blossom were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
 Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't be tempted to take even one specimen.

 All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying or being washed ashore.
 Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not reach there, which makes the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience a polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
