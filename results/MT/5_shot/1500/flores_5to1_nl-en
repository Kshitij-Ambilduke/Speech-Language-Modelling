 This not only proves the widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
 According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were brown with a pale or carotenoid underside.
 The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
 The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
 The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows adult feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
 The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

 In France, voting has traditionally required little technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope marked with the name of the candidate they are voting for.
 Officials first check the voter's identity, then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his or her signature on the voting roll.
 The process is relatively well defined in the French electoral law.
 Ballot boxes have been required to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of the election, and that no other envelopes are added than those of registered and authorized voters.
 The candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

 According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
 There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
 However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, in the James Paget Hospital.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya was subsequently sentenced in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
 She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be a fabrication because her story has been published many times.
 This is standard practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos etc. of suspects.'
 Crown Office has overall control of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are laid.
 According to sources, the document refers to a settlement, something the Palestinians have long wanted on the basis of the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
 Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demands that a permanent military presence be maintained in the valley for 10 years after the agreement is signed, but the PA is only willing to accept a five-year presence.
 Shooters in the supplementary test for pest control had to be closely monitored by foresters, as the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
 In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation had an extensive safety and training instruction.
 Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member provisional electoral council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
 With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP in the last four years, five times.
 Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Election Commission as part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
 The commission was established by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
 The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
 There have been about 60 reported cases of overheated iPods, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents linked to the devices.
 Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious."
 'Very regrettable', was the reaction of the Ministry about the fact that Apple has delayed the report.
 Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
 The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage across the islands.
 In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
 In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
 With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists.
 Several hostages have been rescued and at least six fatalities have been confirmed.
 Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
 Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet, Mendoza was eventually shot.
 Liggins went into medicine and followed in his father's footsteps.
 Trained as a midwife, he began working in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his spare time.
 His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
 Also co-workers paid tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme.' My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
 Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that 'Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
 Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
 Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the federal election of 2010 that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34 percent of respondents to this poll supported this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
 Twenty-nine percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never happen.
 The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his complaints.
 He couldn't take the medicines he needed to ease his pain because they are banned in the Olympics.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
 Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
 Scientists hope to gain insight into the way in which planets are formed, and in particular, they want to know how the Earth was formed, given that it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
 Cuomo, 53, was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He called the rumors "political nonsense and chatter."
 He is speculated to be a candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
 With the NextGen system, the FAA says planes could take shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions.
 It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technologies with ground-based radars, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
 No additional transport is provided and no surface trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
 A possible lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
 A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science, was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, reported that new species evolved within two generations, which was thought to take much longer because the cross-breeding of an indigenous Darwin finch, the Medium ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch, took longer.
 Gold can be worked into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
 It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
 After it has been made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books that were called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
 This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can already make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
 The color of the cabbage juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
 Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested, the pH value is indicated.
 Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
 Mix both dry powders together, wet your hands and clean and make a ball.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
 In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
 Sewage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
 There were also toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. Toilets in the Roman era were often part of a public bathhouse, where both men and women gathered in a mixed group.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
 As soon as the spacecraft receives the call, it immediately sends it back.
 The satellite is shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
 To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
 The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is an easier and faster transport.
 The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
 There are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
 In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats kept as pets) that hunt in larger numbers on small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has, so that they do not compete with others.
 Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
 Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and have up to thirty females and cubs.
 The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
 A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
 The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump great distances and has five times the pulling power of a strong person.
 The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
 A tiger does not roar with full force like a lion. It is more like he growls a whole sentence.
 Ocelots' favorite meal is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than it is.
 Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by sniffing the ground where they have been.
 They can see very well in the dark and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
 When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to an island from which they cannot easily return), they are often in a different environment than before.
 In this new environment, other raw materials and other enemies appear, so the new population must adapt or adapt to be able to face the competition.
 Because they still need the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
 As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
 This process is called speciation and simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
 Through photosynthesis, plants get their nutrients from the sun, and they also provide shade.
 Our houses and clothes are made of plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time, and had nothing to fear except other Mosasauruses.
 His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the mouth, which meant that nothing or no one could escape him.
 It is not certain, but it is possible that his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly even its own kind.
 In water ponds, nothing was safe from his attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
 Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of exotic or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called a dormouse.
 In addition, there was a difference; poor people and women sat on chairs during the meal, but rich men liked to hold a banquet together where they lay on their sides while eating.
 Meals from Roman times do not contain food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
 For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cacao. In addition, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
 The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god's own house.
 People made offerings to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was only accessible to priests.
 Sometimes as part of the temples towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggoeratten.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
 The daily life of the Hebrew family took place mostly outdoors.
 Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, and so wood was very expensive.
 Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and gave it its name.
 He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
 Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the people, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
 After watching the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map hidden behind the Declaration of Independence.
 However, this is a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was once rolled up for storage.
 So it seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
 Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, northern France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
 It was ruled by Vichy France, which was a group of French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France with Operation Dragoon.
 The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks, and then they set off for Germany.
 A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
 From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that defines in a certain way the size of society.
 City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
 When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
 During the revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a Congress.
 The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judicial authority, and to enforce all decisions on state authorities, which often refused to cooperate.
 Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
 First, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is, together with the German team, the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
 Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
 Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with the largest island being Honshu). This makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
 Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'.
 The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, where the VOC took over the indigenous grain production process and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by troops of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), and in 1885 Taiwan was annexed as a province of the Qing Empire.
 After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Built from three large constructions, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they looked like before.
 In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
 For example, the most common photo format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
 These are still produced today, although it is the ratio of the image that the digital camera's image sensor has adopted.
 Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, with a height of 24 mm.
 The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would be 3:2.
 Many common formats (such as APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
 The rule of thirds, which is often misused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet also clear.
 The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
 In this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
 From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
 One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church has the resources to do so.
 The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being followed.
 Great Britain established a blockade of the sea against Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
 The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to civilians and military personnel, but it violated the generally accepted international law that had been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
 Britain laid mines in international waters so that no ships could sail in large parts of the ocean, even for neutral ships.
 Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare of the country.
 During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
 After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
 Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
 When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
 Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided, the best known was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
 At that time, there were heavy wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
 The history of ancient China is marked by the Three Kingdoms period as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
 The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the land belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
 For all male applicants, positions were available after the revolution, so the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
 The same goes for the army. The army ranks are no longer based on one's class but on the caliber of the person.
 The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
 Muhammad was intensely concerned with matters of the spirit. He often went to a cave for meditation, which later became known as the Cave of Hira in the mountains of Noer.
 The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
 The cave is located on one of the mountain tops on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed off from the rest of the world.
 Even though it was known that the cave existed, it was not easy to find. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
 All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the cave, you can see very little of the world.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
 The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of the many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as tributes to Khufu's wives and family members.
 The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a dot or a square with the bottom missing.
 Above means that you should start at the tip and push the iron away. Below means that you should start at the bow (the place where your hand holds the iron) and pull the iron.
 An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
 Take the liberty to sketch your personal signs, but do not forget that the printed staff signs are there for a musical reason, so they should mostly be respected.
 A group of market women sat on October 6, 1789 behind the retreat of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
 They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jeering and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
 The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
 At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
 The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the Filipino people.
 They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
 American imperialism rested in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
 To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
 The period in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
 After the early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term for a large assortment of ideas in practice: from technological supply or technological compulsion to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
 For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
 A national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
 The mass ownership of cars also leads to more accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to repair the human body.
 In Romanticism, a large part of cultural determinism was included, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary imposed laws.
 Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is today.
 It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
 The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
 Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
 The Gothic period was at its height in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
 Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
 Due to the slow communication channels, however, styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
 At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinctive style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began using knots to fasten their clothing.
 Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
 Agriculture for subsistence is a simple system that is usually organic, using stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with rotating crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
 In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. In many developing countries, this is still the case.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
 A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors together.
 Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
 One of the most used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization was the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
 They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical disability of the child.
 Troublesome children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
 Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals, and some have been said to have lived in the wild only.
 A feral child who has not been raised by humans may display behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that raised the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
 Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are faced with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
 Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher is a form of support, but the paperclipmannetje of Microsoft Office is that too.
 There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand without help for students.
 There are several reasons that children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
 No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not loved and where they cannot develop, but this is what happens.
 We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
 The foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
 Foster care must meet all the needs that were neglected in the earlier home.
 The internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
 The different characters of the internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications-theory.
 'Learning' and 'socialisation' are, for example, presented as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
 Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects such as 'personal involvement' and 'continuing relationships' when they investigated audience reactions to Web sites.
 The use of video recordings has led to remarkable discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
 It is argued that no one can recognize a lie by only looking at micro-expressions.
 Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately judge its sincerity.
 He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
 Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
 For each generation, there is variation between the two groups by means of separation and recombination.
 A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive in the savannah, but it is difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that are available there.
 Furthermore, failure to comply can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and even death.
 The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
 Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
 All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees solve this problem in the savannah today.
 Sleep disturbance means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
 This is quite easy to do by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking you up completely.
 If you set your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to sleep (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic). This means you have to get up to go to the bathroom.
 The amount of inner peace a person has is in direct proportion to the amount of stress he or she carries in his or her body and mind.
 The less stress, the more positive the life force. Everyone is able to achieve contentment and total peace.
 Everyone can enlighten his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by a great number of techniques from Indian yoga.
 Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and a following of universal love.
 Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is awakened.
 The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. With the help of the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and the consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
 Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a cooperation between the USSR and the USA was established. After the war, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
 The former allies stood two years after the end of the war opposite each other, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
 The war would last 40 years and proxy armies fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
 The Polish defensive forces held out until 17 September 1939, when they were forced to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
 These plans were however overtaken in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Latvian and Ukrainian frontiers, after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
 Shipping goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
 Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is impeded.
 The U.S. tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to the British and this North Atlantic campaign of WWII is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
 The German Navy tried to stop this traffic at the same time with the help of mainly U-boats.
 Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have been in German hands if the Allies had failed.
 It seems that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always get their hair, meat, milk and skins.
 Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, and were guarded by a goatherd, often a child or younger person, much like the more familiar shepherd. Today, the same method is still used.
 Already in the 16th century horse railways were built in England.
 Although horse railways consisted of only a rail of planks, the horses had to run faster and pull larger loads than on the somewhat difficult roads of that time.
 Cross-ties were used fairly early to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
 This soon became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
 Iron wheels eventually replaced wooden ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were laid.
 The first form of transport we know is walking. People started to walk upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
 Their predecessor, Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
 Fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago show bipedal specializations. The Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
 We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
 In many cases, it is like treating the symptoms. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
 The scientific and technological development of human society has obviously changed the earth dramatically. In addition, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyle have aggravated the problems.
 After the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, a handwritten copy was sent to the printer John Dunlap a few blocks away. This copy was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, and are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
 John Nixon first delivered the public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
 One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
 Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today. We call them birds.
 Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But there are many things about birds that still make them seem like dinosaurs.
 They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
 Manipulating data encoded in binary digits is the basis of nearly all computers in use today.
 A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer science 'bits').
 Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made directly.
 The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indicator of internal poisoning.
 Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
 This insect group is formally called 'true bugs' by entomologists.
 This term comes from an ancient agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans very well.
 Both red velvet ants and bedbugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in the nest or house of their host.
 In the US, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
 A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
 These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
 In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
 However, it is more than just an experiment; an experiment is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to put question marks and to make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts and in particular to the Bible in Latin.
 Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
 The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of the Greek language declined.
 In physiological and behavioral rhythm observations, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and the production via the biological clock.
 Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if there are no external signals for this.
 The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
 Two experiments were performed: in one experiment the DNA in the phage was labelled with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment the protein of the phage was labelled with radioactive sulphur.
 Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells are heritable. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can cause cancer.
 Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
 On site you can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
 An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people from small towns drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are located in the town from which they have just come.
 Everyone in this dynamic transportation shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
 Science has shown that this huge carbon economy has removed the biosphere from its stable state, which has allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
 Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
 In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
 Why is it that so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
 Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that something can be said about this in mathematical terms.
 There are links between the three core characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road engineering facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their flying ability, they could more easily escape predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
 The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
 This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places from predators.
 Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
 A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and the Sun was therefore moving (and other stars).
 This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel that the earth is moving, right?
 The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times the volume of water as the second largest.
 The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
 At least 20% of all water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
 The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old.
 There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
 Italian is the official language of the Vatican City.
 Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is used during religious ceremonies.
 Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
 Humans have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to extract them with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
 Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold.
 Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
 Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms would fit into the tip of this sentence.
 That is why the pencil was a faithful friend for many people when it was launched.
 The pen has unfortunately been lowered in status as newer writing methods have been developed and is now used much less.
 Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
 You might wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
 The atomic bomb works on the principle that it costs energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
 Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
 Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at the slightest provocation.
 The surface of the Moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the Moon.
 The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
 The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
 There may be more mares on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could more easily come to the surface.
 Content theories are concerned with discovering what moves people and what appeals to them.
 This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
 With these theories they want to examine the reasons why certain people want certain things and which environmental factors they influence to do certain things or not.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory.
 In general, there are two ways in which managers lead their former colleagues. In one way, they try to act as equals.
 This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation interviews, to delegate and to hold people accountable.
 On the other side of the spectrum, this person transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she feels the need to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to take ownership of everything.
 Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
 Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are some small differences.
 In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
 They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
 The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
 The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
 Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 Creativity and ingenuity are revealed when all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organization.
 The result of this is that the process of an organization that is working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
 To enable innovation in an organization, management must create a culture that fosters innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, which can reduce the scope of the research and allow more accurate data to be collected.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists during their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
 As new technologies are developed, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
 This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
 AI immediately brings to mind science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
 Developing machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is a branch of AI research.
 Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer questions and diagnoses from customers and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
 These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
 Nowadays, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
 For each class, many excursions are planned. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
 Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artefacts in a museum, to look inside an aquarium or to see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
 Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and whose previous versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
 Blogs can also help students to write better. Often their grammar and spelling are poor at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
 Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and avoid criticism.
 Blogging 'forces students to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
 When used properly, blogs can help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in the discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
 The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
 Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
 These kinds of things make Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
 Further north, large areas are sparsely populated and some of these areas are even almost uninhabited wilderness.
 A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans in the United States than the total population of Canada.
 The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna is almost a separate continent.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, which then spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
 The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
 The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel.
 Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
 It also helps to put rings on (not too expensive looking rings).
 Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour that they perceive as intimidating, such as being followed, being grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Be clear when you reject a man and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not speak well!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides, and was known as Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed the harbour and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
 The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who settled here gave it the name Casablanca.
 In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
 Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the extreme east.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, burying most of the city's streets, and especially the city center.
 Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation with regard to the fighting that is going on in the province of North Kivu before visiting outside Goma.
 In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you can find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
 With boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) you can move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
 Timbuktu is relatively inaccessible and is nowadays used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
 Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
 In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of desert storms.
 It was one of the main stops on the PBS exhibit, Special Wonders from the African World, by Henry Louis Gates.
 The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African.
 Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs in the east along the border with Mozambique, in the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
 19.500 square kilometres is the size of the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild animal species are kept.
 As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance fees apply.
 It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer either access to certain parts of South Africa's parks or to all national parks in South Africa.
 The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists as the main place.
 The skyline of Hong Kong, with its many buildings, has been compared to a glittering bar chart that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbor.
 The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
 This is where the British colonists settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start here.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Indian and Bangladeshi territory.
 The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps — they also contain some of the last mighty stretches of jungle that ever covered the Gangetic plain.
 The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is peat and marshland.
 The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
 During the day, buses leave from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 am, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
 It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
 In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
 Shared taxis can be used to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianan city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
 The two towers are 83 meters high. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
 The bridge is 15 metres high under the bridge. In August 2011, the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened to traffic in March 2017.
 The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
 The Guaraní was the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient agriculture.
 In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
 Paraguay, formerly also called 'the great province of India', was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
 A three-century period of Spanish colonization followed.
 Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
 In December, the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
 There are also smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
 Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is approximately one British pound (GBP).
 There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop, where you can exchange money.
 In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
 You probably can't pay with a credit card on the remote islands, but you can probably pay with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about how you can pay.
 Exchange your money again before you leave the islands, because Falkland Islands currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
 Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30°C are not uncommon.
 Winter can be deceivingly cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 The rainfall level remains approximately the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
 Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
 Keep at least 100 metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 metres away from all other wild animals.
 Elephants, bison, reindeer, bears and pretty much all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them space.
 In addition, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
 The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
 Around the year 1850 Apia was founded and it has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor, later known as the notorious stalemate.
 With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
 In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died in a violent non-violent meeting in the city.
 There are many beaches, especially because of the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
 These are nearly all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
 At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
 These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
 'Number One' is the most important local beer, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
 There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better suited for travel.
 The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
 A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians, who are used to black coffee being 'espresso', cappuccino having lots of coffee (without foam) and tea being served without milk.
 The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
 Trips to the reef are made year round and injuries from these trips to the reef are rare.
 Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
 Jellyfish cubes occur from October to April near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would rather swim away.
 The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
 Reserving in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
 Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, but you can usually also book other accommodation through a travel agency, such as a campsite.
 Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
 They can also hold your reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you have to get documents for your destination (eg visa).
 However, if you have a request or a change, you must do this through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
 For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
 And remember: even if the music on the main stages has finished, there is a chance that there will be music playing on other parts of the festival grounds until late in the night.
 For families with young children, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
 Be careful where your hut is located if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a lot of noise if you are too close.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
 Casinos are usually committed to getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
 They normally have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
 Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
 If you go into the mountains or over mountain passes, you have to take into account that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
 On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
 During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause a traffic jam.
 Also, visibility can be impeded by falling or blowing snow or because there is condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
 On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
 The largest tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
 The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling overland to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
 If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a pair of binoculars, otherwise you will have little chance of seeing them.
 A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') means that you walk for several hours or days in a row.
 The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice, the first time in 1964.
 If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
 Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with normal tickets costing around ¥7,000.
 You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
 If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
 Make sure the fabric is not too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
 You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counter specific risks.
 In some areas, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
 Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, you can best drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
 Travellers may encounter animals that are not found in their own country.
 Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
 Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill humans with violence, are not considered pests.
 Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duty.
 Travellers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a lot of money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
 Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, you often drive through abandoned back country and that makes this route a big challenge.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your head. You will encounter many steep hills, narrow streets and sharp bends.
 The posted speed limits are strikingly lower than in earlier and subsequent areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h — and it is even more important to stick to them than otherwise.
 Surprisingly, you have much more coverage here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
 You see a lot of fruit cakes. All year round, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
 Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want a few small but mighty pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen in the region.
 To make a curry you need spicy and pungent ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
 Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
 In the interior of northern India and also Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.
 Indonesian cuisine encompasses the foods and dishes from 17,000 islands and is a blanket term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
 But without additional information, the term refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
 The cuisine of Java is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, chili, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic herbs.
 Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
 They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a rider can get stuck in them.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but manages to hang on with his foot in the stirrup, he can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
 Most riders wear firstly riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
 Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars. These bars can break away from the saddle if the rider falls backwards.
 Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile, and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large granite walls and boulders.
 The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls that seem to have an endless potential.
 Winter sports where you go downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
 Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
 Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers that date back to 5000 BC!
 The beginning of the ski sport dates at least from the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
 Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skitouring or skihiking.
 It's not exactly the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done on steep terrain. You need much sturdier skis and boots for this.
 You can see the ski route as a hiking route.
 In good conditions you can cover greater distances than walking, but it is rare that you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for multiple visas and passport controls.
 The Schengen area, however, functions in this area almost like a single country.
 As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
 If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
 There is no universal definition that indicates which produced items are antiques. Some tax authorities give goods that are older than 100 years the definition of antiques.
 The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
 It is possible to label handicrafts as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
 Reindeer herding is an important form of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture of trading is also very important for many with other occupations.
 Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They supported themselves with fishing, hunting and such things, and reindeer were mostly used as draft animals.
 Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
 The word 'gypsy' is used primarily by non-Roma, but is also often considered offensive because of associations with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma.
 If there is a travel advisory for the country you are travelling to, this may have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
 In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own citizens.
 For example, Americans in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Advice includes only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
 They often give a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic image in comparison with other, more detailed sources.
 Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
 Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are several types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
 The effects and consequences of severe weather are, for example, strong wind, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and hurricanes.
 Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
 Travellers are advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their surroundings may entail, as these may also affect some travel plans.
 Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
 A search on the Internet for 'courses in hostile environments' is likely to produce the address of a local company.
 In a course, all the issues outlined here are usually covered in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
 A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-plays, a lot of first aid and occasionally weapons training.
 There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are very few publications about war zones.
 Travellers who have planned a sex change operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
 It varies widely whether governments want to issue passports without gender (X) or to correct a name or gender on documents.
 There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
 Searches at security checks have also become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
 Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not come out of this scan with intact privacy and dignity.
 Mudflows are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
 Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
 Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
 When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
 Try to aim for a place where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
 The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
 Travellers who are easily adaptable to new cultures sometimes have difficulty in adapting to their own culture.
 If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your own customs.
 When you used to go abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
 Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
 For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
 You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.
 Often, the sound of vendors and tourists can be heard here. The story of the light and sound is like that of a book.
 The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
 The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids is illuminated.
 The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries, with the most bases, sixteen active in 2020.
 The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
 Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the overflowing crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworth lies on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with Bellingshausen Sea.
 Here the mountains of the peninsula turn into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest peak at 4,892 metres (16,050 ft).
 A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
 A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
 This service is often used by the shipping industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
 Your local telephone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
 It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
 In particular, school leavers make use of this to take a gap year before university without any adverse effects on their studies.
 Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your own country.
 Normally, there is a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
 Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
 A yacht is not necessary for the archipels or lakes.
 The archipels along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
 In Finland, so many people sail in their spare time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
 The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
 Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St Petersburg (Russia).
 You can spend a few full days in the historic town and stay on the ship.
 Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on a boat excursion.
 Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
 It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different than many fears that other people have.
 Knowing how airplanes work can help to dispel fears that come from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the airplane.
 Courier companies are paid a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, purchases or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
 Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
 If they ship things by air, it can take days for them to be unloaded and cleared by customs on some routes.
 Only checked baggage could be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be an accompanying passenger and that is you.
 The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for this privilege (or better, have your employer pay for it).
 However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
 It is usually not worthwhile to look for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know very well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere fast and comfortably and the airlines charge accordingly.
 Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. Here the Romanian language is spoken, but the Russian language is also very common.
 As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by an ethnic conflict.
 In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
 Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
 Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
 Izmir is the second largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
 The once ancient city of Izmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial centre on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
 The broad boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centers covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
 In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
 On a number of graves near the church are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
 If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this village.
 In the north you will find the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra. Sintra became famous with foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of the beautiful monuments there.
 Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
 Also go north and visit the beautiful Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Marian apparitions have taken place.
 Remember that you are actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has a meaning for a large part of the world population.
 Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
 Show respect, solemnity and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialise the Holocaust or Nazism.
 Do not damage the site by marking or graffiti on the buildings.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
 However, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
 In public transport and other facilities Spanish is spoken frequently.
 Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are done by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
 The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude and arrogant.
 Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
 The hard exterior of the Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists primarily of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
 There are a lot of different plant communities, because of the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying height differences.
 This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
 Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the hazel grouse can be found, as well as many more common species.
 When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt to the knee and their shoulders must be covered.
 Most of the time you get a sash cloth as a woman when you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own copy, with nice screaming colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
 On the other hand, men must wear trousers to at least above the knee.
 You can also borrow from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
 Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil is used extensively.
 A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to add flavor, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 Nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
 In this way you make a clear distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
 It probably also makes reading easier. However, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
 Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation generally poses few problems.
 You have to pay attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of these letters depends on the vowel that follows.
 Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means darling, while carro means car.
 The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
 Reading this introduction to the grammar will teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and help you to understand sentences.
 It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
 But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it separately.
 Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational attractions.
 Light pollution was not as big of a problem back then, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are today.
 Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
 The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were only intended for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
 Plants look best in a natural environment, which means you have to resist the temptation to remove even just one species.
 When you collect specimens during a visit to a landscaped garden, you are immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
 But if you are in the 'tropics', but a few degrees to the north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the air is clear, this happens less often).
 There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the supposed burial place of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
 Make sure the bus you take is really going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
 You can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erika Canal.
 They also give popular hiking and cycling routes.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays of the Christian faith, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
 People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
 There is a tradition of staying up all night on Easter Eve until you can see the sunrise.
 Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
 In traditional churches, a Easter Vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where the congregation often celebrates the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
 All animals that originally arrived at the islands came by swimming, flying or drifting.
 Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the journey, and as a result the giant tortoise became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, all sorts of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
 There is a good chance you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost all day and night.
 The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can enjoy the starry sky.
 The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
 Pakken are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by their last name or job title.
 Unity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on group performance rather than on the praise of individual work performance.
