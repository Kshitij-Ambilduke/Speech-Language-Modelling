 While on the one hand there seems to be an experimental vaccine that can reduce mortality from Ebola, on the other hand no drug has yet been found that has clearly been shown to be suitable for the treatment of existing infection.
 An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising in the field, but formal studies revealed lower efficacy than hoped for in preventing deaths.
 In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
 USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
 We agree with USOC that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can best be served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.
 USA Gymnastics has commissioned an independent investigation to understand how such a large-scale abuse of the kind so bravely described by those who have survived Larry Nassar could have been allowed to go undetected for so long, and is committed to implementing any necessary or appropriate changes.
 USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and accountable environment.

 This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-grey on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
 The discovery also allows to obtain detailed information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other features typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
 According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals a plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.
 A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two officers and wounding more than twenty people.

 They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing other than their luminosity and rotation.
 Brightness is used together with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
 The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic reversals.

 The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The team's goal was to be able to detect the effect sought by the tides between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 Scientists were able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that have "normal" matter.
 This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.
 Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
 Local authorities are urging people living near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners and not drink tap water.

 Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
 According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, because of the high mortality rate."
 According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.
 In the course of a year an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 close contacts.
 Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people affected by tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at a given time in South Africa.

 Infrared images show thermal oscillations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
 During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
 Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as steady as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
 In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in a ballot a pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
 After verifying his identity by officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.
 The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very rigorous way.
 Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the beginning of the vote there are no ballot boxes and that no other ballot boxes are added to those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
 Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

 Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
 In addition to the Wednesday event, the Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
 First in slalom, where in the first run she recorded a DNF. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the race.
 The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, she was ranked tenth in the female category "seated", with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
 Four female skiers in the women’s group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
 The police of Madhya Pradesh managed to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen.
 Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
 The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
 None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash was injured.
 Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
 The road on which the accident occurred was closed temporarily, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Since then, Adekoya has been in the custody of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of his own son.
 She is held in custody pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be tainted, since her image has been widely publicized.
 This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters, as the Scottish courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
 According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material about suspicious people are walking on a minefield."
 The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for court proceedings, said it would not be making any further comment until the formal charge was laid.
 According to leaks, the document will be about the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
 Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
 Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such presence only for five years.
 Shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be carefully supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
 As part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
 Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
 This is the fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
 Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
 The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, that have challenged the regime.
 Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
 About 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
 Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
 In its response, the ministry called Apple's decision to postpone the report "absolutely deplorable."
 The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
 According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
 And also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
 In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage some tourists from Hong Kong after hijacking their bus.
 With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza fired on the hostages.
 Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
 Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was fatally struck.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
 After training in midwifery, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While serving at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
 His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight recordings.
 Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
 "Luna was as weird as me… Maybe even more… I love her and I'm going to miss her… Let's hope she's in a better place," was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
 According to a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
 In the course of the 2010 federal election campaign, the then-acting prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
 This view is shared by 34% of respondents, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
 At the other end of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become one.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but suffered a number of injuries that cast doubt on her fitness.
 He was not allowed to take the pain medication he needed to get through the Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
 The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
 Comets could have been one of the sources that led to the Earth's water and organic matter, the material that can form proteins and support life.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
 Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law making same-sex marriage legal.
 In his view, speculation is nothing but "political chatter and nonsense".
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 According to the FAA, NextGen would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
 The system employs satellite technology rather than the obsolete ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
 No additional transport is being laid on and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no car parking or park and ride available on site.
 Fears about the lack of transportation have made it possible to play the game obligatorily behind closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
 According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has emerged on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
 According to researchers from Princeton University, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time necessary for this process was much greater; this is due to the mating between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
 It can be drawn into a thin wire, suitable for being twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
 This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the cabbage juice is possible to build a pH indicator.
 The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
 The pH level of the chemical being analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
 Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them into a ball.
 Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
 Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
 In Greece, in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewers.
 Toilets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
 To call someone far away thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
 The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
 The satellite was launched into space with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision in part.
 To transport a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket must be more than 100 feet tall.
 The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
 Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation have made their appearance.
 Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that feed on small prey, which are much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
 Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called prides.
 The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
 Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
 The lion pride acts in a very similar way to the wolf or dog pack, whose behaviour is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not of other big cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
 A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
 The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
 The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a sentence of words shouted and angry.
 Ocelots love to eat small animals, and if possible, they go after monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than they are.
 Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
 Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, and are also able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then swoop down on them.
 When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than the one it was in before.
 This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
 The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it will look less and less like the other population.
 At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
 This process, which involves the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (through breathing).
 Plants process their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
 We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era and for this reason it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
 From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so that for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
 We don't know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is possible that it was a cannibal.
 He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
 Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included some strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a rodent called a squirrel.
 Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
 Of course, the diet of the ancient Romans did not include many foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
 For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
 The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the home of the god.
 People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
 Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
 Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of paramount importance.
 Much of the Jewish family life took place outdoors.
 Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple stalls on the street. Stone was used to build houses.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red named it after his voyage there after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
 But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
 Although all of them are "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were very different.
 If you've seen the movie "The Da Vinci Code", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map to the treasure.
 However, this is false. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
 Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
 Probably, therefore, the annotation was only added as a label.
 The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
 It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
 American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
 Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in a collaborative manner, forming a society.
 The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn linked with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in some way defines the dimensions of society.
 The city-states are the first to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge through several generations, to leave an indelible cultural imprint through an equal diffusion.
 Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
 During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was its only member, according to the Articles of Confederation.
 Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
 He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
 To amend the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which in turn had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
 Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
 Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
 From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
 Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by soon recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the aboriginal cereal production systems and recruiting Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
 After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
 Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
 Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
 In 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
 The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the analogue photography era.
 It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
 Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
 The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
 The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
 The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
 According to this rule, the most effective place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
 At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
 Christianity had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
 His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to the common people.
 One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
 The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
 Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
 The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law, which has been accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent access to entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
 As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate U-boat campaign.
 In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
 After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
 He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
 In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
 The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most famous was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
 In these times, between many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars broke out.
 The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to gain a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
 The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can cite the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
 In addition, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
 The same goes for the military, since the army’s rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
 The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the life of this world. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
 The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad.
 The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
 In reality, it is not easy to find, even if it is known to exist. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
 There is nothing to see but a beautiful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
 Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day.
 Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The important pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family.
 The "up arc" sign looks like a V and the "down arc" sign looks like a staple or a square with no bottom.
 Upwards means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
 An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger and more decisive sound.
 You can decide to add your personalized indications with a pencil, but keep in mind that the archeggio signs you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
 On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with his wife Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and his sister Elisabeth.
 With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the sovereigns.
 The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
 At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
 The war expenses of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
 Clearly, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the profits at the base of US imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, we must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
 The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the XI, XII and XIII centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
 The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends conventionally in about 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has its own "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
 For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
 However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
 The mass ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new techniques of rescue for the care of injured people.
 Romanticism was characterized by a strong deterministic cultural component, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs and culture have arisen linked to this geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
 Like Paris, nowadays known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
 Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
 During the twelfth century its prestige declined, especially because the crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
 It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
 The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
 Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
 But the slowness of communication routes means that the diffusion of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothing.
 Subsistence agriculture is defined as agriculture practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, using locally adapted seeds in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing harvests.
 Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it is still the case.
 Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
 The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
 One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, following misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
 These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
 Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
 Other children may have been raised by animals; others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
 When a feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
 Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather a support for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to query, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
 Children are given up for adoption for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
 A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide him with nourishment, care and education, but they do.
 We believe that foster care is a safe place for these children.
 Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
 It is assumed that fostering meets all the needs not met in the home from which the child was removed.
 The Internet combines some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
 The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
 For example, important motivations for using the Internet are suggested to be "learning" and "socializing" (James et al., 1995).
 Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to web sites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
 The use of video recording has allowed to reach significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
 In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks has illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
 He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
 In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
 With mutation, new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
 Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
 For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
 In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
 The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
 Animal foods (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
 In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep interruption is the intentional process of waking during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10–60 minutes later).
 This process can be easily practiced using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
 If you decide to reset the clock in the sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options based on the biorhythm include the consumption of many liquids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
 A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension in his body and spirit.
 The less tension, the more positive the vital force existing. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
 In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-embracing love.
 Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts led to a break between the two countries.
 Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; the Cold War had begun.
 It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
 On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans proved to be obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
 Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
 The task of the Navy has always been to ensure the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
 One of the most recent examples in support of this theory and most worthy of note is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
 At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
 If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
 It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 They were first bred by ancient cultures and tribes for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
 Domestic goats were usually raised in herds allowed to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herders (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
 Already in the 16th century in England were built the wagonway.
 Although they were simply made of parallel wooden rails, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled on them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
 The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in position. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a bar of iron on top.
 It became a common practice, even if the iron caused greater wear of the wooden wheels of the carriages.
 Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
 The first means of transportation that man has known are the legs. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
 His predecessor, the australopithecine, did not habitually walk upright.
 Signs of bipedalism are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
 To try to mitigate in some way the future suffering we can start to adopt lifestyles more respectful of the environment, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
 In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we want a permanent solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
 It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
 After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were produced in the night, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsheets".
 The document was first publicly read on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
 One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, while a copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest known copies of the document, the original manuscript having been lost.
 According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
 Many tend to not consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
 Yet birds have many features that are common to dinosaurs.
 Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
 In the end, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
 A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer science these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
 Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
 The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
 Check the label to see if there are first aid instructions for that specific poison.
 The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
 The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become parasites of man.
 Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting insects, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
 In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 The research has shown that the probability of developing MS in females is twice that of males.
 A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their child.
 These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
 In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific inquiry.
 But it is not only experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows to guide scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
 Aristotle's opinions on various matters of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to periodic external signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
 One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
 Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells affected belong to the germ line.
 The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of the germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
 Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including flora and fauna.
 Examples of activities to do on the spot include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
 For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
 Every morning, people leave the small country towns to go to work by car, crossing other people whose place of work is the place from which they have just left.
 In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a system of transport based on private cars, which in turn support.
 Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
 Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
 In developed countries, it is rare to hear such levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that fall into disrepair.
 Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
 Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
 Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
 Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
 In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
 Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects are benefited by the ability to fold their wings along their body.
 This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
 Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
 Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars), moved around the Earth.
 Which seems reasonable, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
 The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river in the world. It carries 8 times the amount of water of the second largest river.
 The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
 The total 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
 The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
 Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their ancestors, who were by then more than a thousand years old.
 The population of the Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
 The official language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
 Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
 In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
 Man has known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
 According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
 These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
 Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
 There may also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
 In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are incredibly tiny, so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 After its invention, the pencil has proved to be a good friend to many.
 Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less widespread use.
 Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a temperamatite.
 We can only wonder what fate will have the keyboard when something newer arrives.
 The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
 In effect, it is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by splitting the nucleus further, some of that energy is released.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up in the presence of a weak or no push.
 The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
 The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
 It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
 The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
 Content theories focus on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
 According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they have grown up.
 These theories analyze what is common to some people and pushes them to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
 Among the most popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
 The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
 At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels he must change the entire team's operation and make it his own.
 Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 This attitude often creates dissension among leaders and the rest of the team.
 The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
 Members of the virtual team often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, since meetings can take place according to different time zones, which may not be covered by the local management.
 The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member refers and is the one that establishes the standards for each member.
 Why would an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
 When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
 Consequently, the collaborative path within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
 For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
 Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
 The link between brain disease and behaviour is at the heart of the scientists' research.
 It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
 The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
 This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
 Although it has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
 AI research includes building machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
 These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
 AI is nowadays often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
 Field trips are an important part of the curriculum. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
 The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
 Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
 For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
 Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, their first experiences with blogging are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
 Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author commits to improve his writing.
 Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment they are in" and the need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning beyond the normal school day.
 The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
 Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural beauty and unspoiled wilderness of the Muskoka region and much more.
 All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
 The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
 The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
 Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
 In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey towards the Comoros and Mayotte.
 In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
 To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
 For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
 Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Have the courage to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides.
 The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
 The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, and then named it Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
 Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
 In the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
 In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
 While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do some research before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess the state of the fighting that still persists in the North Kivu province.
 The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
 It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
 Also because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
 Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also with an airport.
 In 1990 it was included in the list of Unesco heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
 In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the featured stops.
 With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
 The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, in the north it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
 With an area of 19,500 km², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
 It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
 Buying a Wild Card may also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
 The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
 The series of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart, made all the more apparent by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the bay.
 Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the reclaimed lands of the densely populated northern shore.
 This is the place that the British colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
 The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
 However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the once vast jungles that covered the Ganges plain.
 The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is made up of marshy areas.
 Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, though many (especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
 Since buses between different districts are often full, it is best to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
 Most of the neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
 Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
 Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
 Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
 By September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
 The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
 Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the XVI century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
 The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
 Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its autochthonous characteristics.
 Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and players in the world.
 In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the Las Cañitas polo fields.
 Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
 For information on tournaments and tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
 The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), which is worth the same as the British pound (GBP).
 The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West shop, offers currency exchange service.
 British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
 It is likely that the remote islands will not accept credit cards, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
 It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
 Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer in Montevideo while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is situated in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures over 30°C are quite normal.
 Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
 There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
 Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
 Park authorities recommend keeping at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
 No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a safe distance. It is necessary to leave these animals a proper space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
 Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong odors, and keep your camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 In this port there was the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
 All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
 In the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
 There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbours, and the most popular are divided into three areas.
 The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
 These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
 These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops, and safe for swimming.
 The most well-known local beer is a simple, refreshing and pleasant beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
 You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might fare better on the journey.
 The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
 According to Australians, the flat white coffee is a foreign idea. The espresso is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
 Hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
 All year round, many excursions are made to the coral reef and injuries from one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
 Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
 Cubomedusae appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
 Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
 The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living in the ocean.
 By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
 Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is also possible to book other accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
 Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight + hotel packages.
 They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
 However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
 On the occasion of some musical festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
 To be close to the action, you need to get there early and grab a spot near the music.
 Remember that once the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the crossing of the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed.
 St Petersburg cruises include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
 Casinos generally do everything they can to increase the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
 They usually offer food, drinks and exclusive entertainment to keep the mood of the guests high and make them stay.
 In some establishments alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication alters the capacity for judgement and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
 Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
 On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
 During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in such a short time that you can get stuck.
 Even precipitation and gusts of snow, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
 However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
 Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
 In its popular usage, the term safari refers to overland travel, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come closer to cars, so a normal camera is sufficient to get a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
 A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari escursionistico", or "safari on foot") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
 The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the first of which was held in 1964.
 If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but most of the cancellation policies linked to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not go up to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
 It is expected that the cost of most tickets for the events will be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
 Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
 If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
 Be careful not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
 There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
 In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
 The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
 Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
 Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
 The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually classified as harmful animals.
 Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax-free and excise-free products in certain locations.
 Travelers headed to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
 The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas in the vegetation.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as there are steep slopes, narrow streets and tight curves.
 The speed limits shown are much lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
 Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
 Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from apples available all year round to cherries and plums, which appear during the summer.
 Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes are often very well combined with a cup of strong coffee.
 Those who want to taste small but tasty cakes can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
 Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
 Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
 In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the interior regions is usually used yogurt; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent is more used coconut milk.
 With 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
 However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
 The cuisine of Java, now widely diffused throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
 They provide greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped.
 If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged along by the horse as it runs away. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
 First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
 Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have inserted safety bars, which make a leather strap detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
 Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs.
 The peaks of the mountains include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly tracing new routes on its walls, potentially endless.
 Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
 Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to the skiing in a particular area.
 The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
 Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
 Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, alpine skiing or trekking on skis.
 It is related, though usually not included, to touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
 Think of the ski run as a similar path to the hiking trail.
 If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but you will only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
 However, in this respect, the Schengen area works more like a single country.
 If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to go through passport control again.
 Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
 There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
 The definition has geographical differences compared to the age limit which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
 Craft objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
 Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis for many other professions.
 Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale; some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as work animals.
 Today, many Sámi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
 Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
 If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you are visiting, there could be consequences to your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
 You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Alerts are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
 The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
 "Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
 Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, above-average rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes and cyclones.
 Among the phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
 Travelers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect travel planning.
 Anyone planning to visit a country that is potentially considered a war zone should receive professional training.
 Searching the Internet for 'Survival course' is likely to find the address of a local company.
 A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with the help of practical experience.
 A standard course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wild are popular, while there are few publications about war zones.
 Travellers planning to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have the right documents for their return journey.
 The intention of governments to issue passports without gender indications (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
 The availability of foreign governments to accept such documents is also variable.
 Even the security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11 era.
 Transgender people in the pre-operative stage should not expect to pass through the controls without their privacy and dignity being violated.
 Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
 Given the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
 Most deaths occur from exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
 As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will not be as difficult as usual.
 Try to find an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
 Re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than cultural shock (since there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
 Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their home country.
 When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home country.
 In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
 Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
 The pyramid's light and sound show is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
 Before the start of the show, you can admire the pyramids in the darkness and silence.
 You can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, but the show of lights and sounds is like a book of stories.
 The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
 The scenes are projected on the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
 Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
 The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George is the largest and is the seat of the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
 Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water has created a magnificent natural harbor.
 Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and faces the Bellingshausen Sea.
 Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, to then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
 In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
 A satellite phone is not a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
 The service is often used by pleasure craft, including those for recreational purposes, as well as by missions that require data and voice at a distance.
 Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
 One of the most popular options among those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
 It is particularly popular among recent graduates, since they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
 In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon return to the home country.
 Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
 Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
 You don’t need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
 Even though the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
 Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
 This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (for example in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
 Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
 No separate visa is required for shore excursions (as of 2009).
 Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
 Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
 There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and aversions that many people have towards other things.
 For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
 Drivers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
 For some routes the larger companies used their own aircraft, but for other routes and for smaller companies there were problems.
 On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs clearance.
 The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as freight, and that's where you come in, because airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
 To fly first or business class, the obvious way is to pay a pretty penny for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do it).
 However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for First Class travel!
 In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
 Airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result they apply certain fares.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also very widespread.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of an ethnic conflict in the past.
 In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
 Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
 The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
 The ancient city of Izmir is built on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, developed and active commercial center.
 Although the city has a Mediterranean feel, with wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres, it is dotted with the distinctive red-tiled roofs of the 18th-century market, mosques and churches.
 In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
 In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
 Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
 To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily reached. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
 The Scotturb 403 bus line regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
 Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
 Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has an incalculable meaning for a significant part of the world's population.
 There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
 Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
 Please avoid defacing these places by scribbling on the structures with marks or graffiti.
 In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
 However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the official first language by law.
 Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
 On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan, but any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
 Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Although it is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is to behave as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person would, which will definitely facilitate your movements.
 The rough exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic good manners.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mostly beech, pine and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
 The area also hosts a great variety of animal and bird species.
 In these places live rare species such as the brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie, along with several other animal species more widespread.
 When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and to cover their shoulders.
 Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it is brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
 In a similar way, men are required to wear long pants below the knees.
 These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a single size for all!
 The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
 The Pa amb Oli is a popular simple dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "you", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
 This represents an important mechanism to distinguish certain verbs and complements.
 This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes the writing rather complex.
 Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
 The main letters to pay attention to are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
 Also make sure you pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
 Persian has a relatively simple grammar and is mostly regular.
 So, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
 It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
 However, people with a basic knowledge of Spanish may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough and therefore need not be studied separately.
 Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
 Since light pollution was not a problem in their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
 The admiration of cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 The concept was originally from China, where the flowering of the plum trees was preferred.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
 Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even just one.
 If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
 In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
 But being in the "tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
 Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional place where the Bible's patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
 Make sure the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
 For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
 They also define the paths of hiking trails and bicycle paths very well known.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
 Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
 A tradition is to spend the Easter night awake in an open place to admire the dawn.
 There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian fertility ritual linked to spring.
 In more traditional churches, a Paschal Vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
 Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, mammals were unable to make the journey, which meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
 Several mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you can experience polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
 This phenomenon offers the possibility of attending the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
 Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
 In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
 Office dress is normally a jacket and tie or a suit and one addresses colleagues by their surname or professional title.
 The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than to the individual achievements.
 Workers must often receive the approval of their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
