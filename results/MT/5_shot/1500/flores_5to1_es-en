 USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's statement and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
 We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be better served if we move forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than withdrawing certifications.
 USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors described with such courage could have gone unseen for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
 The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
 During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
 He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 election, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

 In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widespread, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
 According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid tone in the lower part.
 The discovery also allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
 Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed shaft, but do have other features of feathers (barbs and barbules), the researchers concluded that the shaft is likely the result of an evolutionary development of these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but rather to regulate temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
 The experts' assessment was that, even though it is the tail of a dinosaur of short age, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

 It was discovered that the sun was governed by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors driving its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
 The intensity of the light and the rotation are combined to calculate the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
 The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to its magnetic reversals.

 He warns that no one can give assurances that any Iraqi action at this point will halt sectarian fighting, rising violence or a slide into chaos.
 The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus in the United States about Middle East policies.
 The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
 It contains 78 recommendations, the first of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year to protect Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbors.
 Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the post of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Buenos Aires, that she will run for the presidency.
 The Argentine Theater was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same site where she began her campaign for the Senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
 The issue that sparked the debate was the controversy over the budget allocated to the relief and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, a measure that some fiscal conservatives have dubbed the "Bush New Orleans Agreement."
 Criticism of the liberals in relation to the restoration works focuses on the fact that contracts for reconstruction have been awarded to people who, apparently, are Washington officials.

 Although it was an eminently theoretical work, the program was drafted with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the Sagittarius galaxy.
 It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
 The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius Galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
 The experts concluded that dark matter interacts with itself in the same way that regular matter does.
 This theory holds that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located in a kind of halo around it and is made up of numerous small particles.

 Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululandia.
 During an interview, he said that the new variant was "causing a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
 Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
 In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
 However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB patient population still appears to be low: 6000 out of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular point in time in South Africa.

 The authorities have also guaranteed several million vials of the vaccine to fight encephalitis, which will allow healthcare companies to prepare for next year.
 This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and the low priority, compared to other diseases, have caused delays in the implementation of the vaccine delivery plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.

 As the infrared images show, temperature variations during the day and night indicate that they are probably caves.
 During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface and, at night, higher.
 “While its thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep subsurface cavities,” said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, in Flagstaff, Arizona.
 In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters seal themselves in a booth and drop a pre-printed ballot into an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
 After officials verify the identity of the voter, he or she deposits the ballot in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
 French electoral law establishes the procedures quite strictly.
 Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no surpluses at the beginning of the vote and that no others are added other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
 The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

 Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet, with Norman Lamb MP expected to take over the business ministerial post Davey vacates.
 February 16 is the date Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court.
 Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 years old respectively, died. The latter was driving.
 Edgar Veguilla suffered wounds to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
 Uka's gun jammed as he pointed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, cannot see out of one eye, has a missing part of his skull and his face had to be rebuilt with titanium.
 Schneider testified via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
 Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the competition of Wednesday.
 The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a «Did Not Finish» in the first run, as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
 In her other race, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
 Four category skiers sitting out failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants out of 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
 The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
 Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who misbehaved with the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
 Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
 According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
 Although there were three people inside the house at the time of the car impact, none of them were injured.
 However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, accused of the murder of her son.
 While she is in custody awaiting charges and trial, any statement by an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
 It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
 Pamela Ferguson, a lecturer at the University of Dundee, said: "It seems journalists are treading on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects.
 The Crown Office, which handles prosecutions, told reporters it would make no further comment at least until the indictment is issued.
 According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the boundaries in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
 Other topics that were also addressed, according to the report, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
 During the pest control supplementary test, the rangers had to closely supervise the shooters, as they were being monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
 In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Deer Hunters Association (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited from the Deer Hunters Association shooting program.
 Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that comprehensive training in safety and training was given to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
 Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, by its initials in English).
 In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
 Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
 The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
 The protests, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that elections have not been held in some cases since 2011.
 Around 60 cases of iPods with problems of operation and excessive heating have been reported, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
 Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company categorized as “not serious.”
 The ministry commented on the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable."
 Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
 The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the territory.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
 In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer hijacked a bus and held hostage tourists who came from Hong Kong.
 Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
 Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
 Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
 Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was gunned down.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
 She trained in obstetrics and entered the Auckland National Women's Hospital around 1959.
 Liggins began her research on premature birth in her spare time, while working at the hospital.
 His study showed that the fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
 Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators were able to retrieve the flight recorders from the black box.
 Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
 Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
 Dustin Oro en Polvo Runnels stated: «Luna was as rare as me; even more. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place».
 Since 2008, among the 1,400 surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, there was an 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
 Julia Gillard, the acting prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
 34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last queen of Australia.
 At one end of the survey is a 29% of people who think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, a 31% who believe it should never happen.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
 He has not been able to take pain medication to ease the pain, because it is forbidden to use them in the Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known.
 Many people verified the discovery using various types of hardware and software and it was made public on Tuesday.
 Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
 The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets originate, in particular ours, given that comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
 Cuomo, 53, took office at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
 He called the rumors «political chatter and nonsense.»
 He is speculated to run for the presidential election in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
 It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
 No additional transportation will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and deterrent will not be available.
 Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team, was considered.
 On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
 Experts from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was thought that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can take on all kinds of shapes and curl into tiny figures.
 Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched to a very thin wire that can be twisted and braided.
 It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. It is so thin that it was once used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
 The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
 The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being analyzed determines its pH level.
 Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
 Stir both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean, moistened hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
 A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with flushing in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
 In some households of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, there are vestiges of sewer systems.
 They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
 When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
 The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light from the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light we see.
 A giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, is needed to get a satellite or telescope into outer space.
 The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to provide us with a much simpler and faster form of transportation.
 Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
 Below, there are more moderate sized felines that feed on medium sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that are much more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
 Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called prides.
 The herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
 Generally, females relate closely to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides behave in the same way as wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike other big cats) in both their behaviour and in being highly lethal to their prey.
 An all-around athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
 The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
 The tiger's roar is not a fully sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather, like a prayer of words spoken in growls and screams.
 Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are smaller than they are.
 Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, sniffing the ground where they have passed.
 They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
 When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main group from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were used to.
 The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
 There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
 Over time, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
 Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
 This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
 Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (that they emit).
 Plants generate their food with the energy of the sun, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide us with shade.
 We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other members of its own species.
 Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded in them, plus an additional set in the roof of its mouth, which meant that anything that came in front of it had no escape.
 We are not sure, but it could have had viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
 He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
 While most of that food would be familiar to us, Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
 Another thing that differentiated them was that the humble people and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and throwing themselves sideways while eating.
 It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
 For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
 The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
 People carried sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those by performing ceremonies and festivals.
 The temples had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
 Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for their deity.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of major importance.
 Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
 Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were merely showcases that faced the street. Houses were built of stone.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Very few inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a trip he made further west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
 Nevertheless, despite their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the place at that time.
 While each country was "Scandinavian" in its own right, there were marked differences in the people, monarchs, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 However, that is not true. While the back of the document does contain something written, it is not a map to a treasure.
 The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" written on the back of the document, in the bottom corner.
 Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the enormous parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
 Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
 While the landings during D-Day, as well as subsequent engagements, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the south remained.
 His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
 On August 15, 1940, the so-called «Operation Dragon» was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
 In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving on to Germany.
 A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that is part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
 The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of the society.
 The state cities are the precursors of the nations. A civilization culture entails a long-term intergenerational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
 Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
 During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
 Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, the states often failed to cooperate in enforcing all of their laws.
 Nor was he empowered to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
 The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Among the sports that are practiced the most are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 races.
 Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
 Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
 Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
 The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
 The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
 In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who retains its control over the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can see what they looked like originally.
 By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
 To exemplify, the most common format of still photography globally is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
 Today it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
 In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
 This is why the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
 Many typical formats (e.g., the APS group of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
 The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant jokes and ridicule, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while allowing some order to the images.
 It indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection that is formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
 During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
 For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states despite their different languages and customs.
 His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the plebeian.
 One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
 The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
 Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
 While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated generally recognized international law and was in breach of several international agreements of the past two centuries.
 Britain extracted international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting at risk neutral ships.
 Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 Throughout the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
 After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
 He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
 Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
 During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were disputing the throne.
 One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the grand palace in Xi'an.
 There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
 Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
 The same is true of the military, as instead of basing army ranks on classes, they are now based on caliber.
 The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed working people in other countries to face their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as Hira in the mountain of Noor (light) to reflect.
 The cave itself, which has survived the ages, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
 At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally cut off from the rest of the planet.
 Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence, and inside the cave, the isolation is total.
 Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
 Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
 The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of his wives and family.
 The "upward arc" mark resembles a V and the "downward arc" mark is similar to a staple or square without its bottom edge.
 Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the heel, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
 The upward movement of the bow generates a softer sound, while a downward movement is louder and more abrupt.
 Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but please remember that the marks on the bowed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should be respected.
 On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, eleven, and Louis Charles, four), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
 They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob who shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
 The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
 At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
 The Filipino people themselves paid the costs of the U.S. imperialism's war in the conquest of the Philippines.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the interest and principal on bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
 From the very beginning, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of U.S. imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the order.
 The European historical period in which these events take place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (i.e., between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
 The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
 Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development in itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
 To take one example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily entails the development of roads.
 However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
 The mass use of automobiles also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
 The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography and, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
 Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
 Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 B.C. and extended until approximately 1100 A.D.
 During the twelfth century its status declined, mainly because, on their return, the crusaders brought gifts such as silks and spices, which were more highly valued than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
 The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
 At first, the way of dressing received great influence from Byzantine culture in the east.
 However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
 Subsistence agriculture is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to meet exclusively the needs of the farmer and his family group.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic practice that combines the use of regionally indigenous stored seeds with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
 Historically, much of the farmers' main activity was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
 Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization from social standards and gives them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
 There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
 The features that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
 It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit signs of their membership by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashions, gestures, and jargon.
 One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
 These children are called «feral». Some feral children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents to the serious intellectual or physical disability that the child has.
 It is possible that the wild children had suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
 Some were raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
 When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
 While project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the animated little clipboard in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
 Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
 No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
 We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
 The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
 The objective of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were removed.
 The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
 The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
 For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 During a study of user reactions to Web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" were also detected as new motivational factors.
 Through the recording of videos, important findings have been produced in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds duration.
 Specifically, it is argued that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
 Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
 Even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
 Through the research of the twentieth century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
 The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from the pool of variations.
 Segregation and recombination shuffle variation from one generation to the next.
 In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to meet its amino acid needs with the plant resources available.
 Not doing so causes serious problems: slowed growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the most readily available source of plant food, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
 In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
 In short, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their own «protein problems» in the same way as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep deprivation consists of waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and falling asleep again after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
 This can be achieved easily with a more or less gentle alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state, although without waking him up completely.
 Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
 Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist in drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force him to get up to urinate.
 The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and in his spirit.
 The lower the tension, the more positive the life force we have. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
 We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the way is our tension and negativity.
 While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, it has been extended by the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
 In general terms, laïcité is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
 In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
 Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
 The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, system, process and culture clashes ended up distancing the two countries.
 Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
 It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
 By September 17, 1939, Polish defense was already broken, and their only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
 Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
 The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
 The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and material across the Atlantic to support Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to nullify this traffic.
 If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have taken over Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
 Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 In order to obtain their milk, hair, meat and leather easily, the ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them.
 Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
 In England, railways had been installed by the 16th century.
 Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve greater speed and to haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
 The incorporation of ties to keep the rails in place occurred quite early, but gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on the top.
 This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
 Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767, solid iron rails were used.
 The first form of transportation that was known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
 His predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
 While bipedal traces have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
 We can start to live a more planet-friendly life, join environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the future suffering.
 It is, in many cases, like the treatment of the asymptomatic. But if we are not looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
 It is evident that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
 After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer John Dunlap, a few blocks away, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies".
 It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
 A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9. Another copy arrived in London on August 10.
 The 25 photographs by Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document that have been preserved. The original manuscript has been lost.
 A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. They are the birds.
 Many people don't picture them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
 However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
 They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
 Nowadays, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of data encoded in the binary system.
 A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
 Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be able to make an immediate diagnosis.
 The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be to find an open bottle of toxic medicines or cleaning products.
 Read the label for specific first aid information for that specific poison.
 Entomologists use the term insect parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
 The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species that has evolved to parasitize humans.
 Bed bugs and assassin bugs are nesting insects; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
 The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
 The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
 Studies have indicated that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from MS.
 A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the best thing for them or for the child.
 These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
 The ultimate goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
 It is not, however, an experimentation, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
 The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was put on classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
 The thoughts of Aristotle, especially the questions of science, even psychology, were accepted.
 As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, even in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
 Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustained manner and have a free cyclical operating period, even if there are no external stimuli.
 One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
 Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phage, or viruses.
 They performed two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
 Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
 Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wildlife and plant life.
 Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
 An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they have just left.
 In this dynamic transfer shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and sustained by a transportation system based on the use of private automobiles.
 Scientists now believe that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humankind for the last two million years.
 Everyone is part of society and makes use of transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
 In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
 What is the reason for transportation systems to give rise to complaints of such magnitude and why do failures occur on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent or is there something more substantial going on?
 Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
 Unfortunately, it is not easy to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
 Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to behave in a relatively consistent way, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
 In order to more clearly graph the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
 Such relations facilitate both the planning and design as well as the operations of the roadway devices.
 The first species to fly were insects, which helped them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
 Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold the wings back, sticking them to the sides of the body.
 This gives them a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
 Currently, anisoptera and ephemeroptera are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
 Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
 Some shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
 This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
 The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the next largest river.
 In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
 Of the total water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
 The great Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
 While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, none could surpass those of Giza, neither in size nor in the sublimity of the technique of their construction.
 The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a millennium.
 With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in terms of population.
 Italian is used in Vatican City, both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communications.
 The language spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
 All citizens living in Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic religion.
 The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
 Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
 Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. Also, there are metals such as gold and silver.
 It is also possible that alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, are present.
 Everything in the Universe is made of matter, which is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
 The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the end point of this sentence could contain billions of them.
 So when it was invented, the pencil made many friends.
 Unfortunately, with the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
 Nowadays, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to approach a typewriter.
 It is only a matter of time before something new comes along.
 The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
 It is similar to what happens when a heavy car is rolling uphill. By splitting the core once more, it releases some of that energy.
 The cores of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to break down with a minimum or almost no push.
 The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
 The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
 It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
 It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on what it is that attracts or pleases people.
 These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
 These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
 Two theories of very well known are the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and the two factors, of Hertzberg.
 In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
 Managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that employees dislike, to impose disciplinary measures, to conduct performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything that the group has been doing so far and to do it in his own way.
 After all, the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
 This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
 The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some minor differences.
 Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
 They usually enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
 The existence of an «invisible team» (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of the virtual teams.
 The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
 What motive could an organization have for subjecting itself to the demanding process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to foster innovation.
 When all available resources are used appropriately in the operating departments of an organization, it creates room for creativity and ingenuity.
 As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty leads to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
 For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
 Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. They therefore narrow the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
 The existing correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
 Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
 This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which enhance our understanding of mental processes.
 While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
 Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as facial recognition, writing, voice.
 These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
 Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way that it has been incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
 Field trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
 The solution comes from technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
 Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, every year, the students at Bennet Elementary in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of a scrapbook.
 Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing. Although students usually start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
 Because students are often the most critical readers, the blog writer starts to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
 Blogging, too, "requires students to be more sympathetic to the world around them." The need to pique the interest of the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
 The proper use of blogs «can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, in addition to establishing their perspectives on specific topics» (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that display the history and current events of the country.
 Niagara Falls are further south and the north hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
 All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario seem intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
 The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
 To make a population comparison that is surprising to many: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians.
 The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
 Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
 The initial point of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that connects the Cape of Europe with India.
 The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
 Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
 Women should be aware that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Be firm in rejecting men and do not hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that is not right!).
 The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century B.C. and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
 It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after an earthquake.
 The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan Sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
 Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
 In the outskirts of the old Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared up for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist destination in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
 In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
 While Goma is quite safe, any visit to the outside should be considered in order to take note of the situation of the confrontations that persist in the province of North Kivu.
 The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the cheapest in Africa.
 To get around Goma, you can take a bodaboda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
 This, combined with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Timbuktu an image of an exotic and distant land.
 Although today Timbuktu is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
 In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered heritage sites, as a result of the threat of desert sands.
 It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates's PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
 The city contrasts much with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
 Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
 The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
 This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African nature reserves, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
 It may also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or all National Parks in the country.
 The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the homonymous island, which is the destination most of the tourists consider the main attraction.
 The deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a light bar graph that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located in front.
 It is in the lands recovered from the north coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated, densely.
 This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
 The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
 UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The forest section within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 Notwithstanding, the forests are not only mangroves, but they also have some of the last trees that remain of the once-imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plains.
 The Sundarbans comprise an area of 3850 km2 and nearly a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
 The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
 Buses leave the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
 Because buses between districts are often crowded with passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Almost all districts have the service of Japanese buses Coaster, which are comfortable and durable.
 Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
 The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
 Below the bridge is a 15-meter-wide space, and while its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
 Full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
 The area that now constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraní, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was home to other aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
 Paraguay, formerly known as «The Gigantic Province of the Indies», was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
 The Spanish started the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
 Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal idiosyncrasy and identity.
 Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best players of polo in the world.
 The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
 Other lower level tournaments and matches may also be held at other times of the year.
 The Argentine Polo Association website will provide information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
 The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
 There is a single bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the FIC West shop in Stanley.
 Pounds sterling are usually accepted anywhere within the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
 There is a possibility that credit cards are not accepted on the islands of the periphery, but you could use British or American money. Ask in advance to the owners to be able to define which is the accepted method of payment.
 It is practically impossible to change money outside the Falkland Islands, so try to do so before you leave.
 Because Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
 Winter cold can be deceiving: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
 While many of the park's animals are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so don't feed or bother it.
 According to park officials, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from the rest of the wildlife.
 No matter how docile they may appear, bison, wapiti, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
 Dozens of visitors are injured each year by not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
 Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking food that gives off a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
 The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40 000 inhabitants.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
 In 1889, the port was the scene of a nefarious naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
 They sank all the ships, except a British cruiser. Nearly two hundred Americans and Germans died.
 During the independence war that the Mau movement fought, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
 There are a large number of beaches, as Auckland has two harbours, the most well-known being in three areas.
 In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 The beaches are almost all sandy with safe swimming spots and mostly have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
 In the port of Waitemataas are deployed the beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
 These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
 Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
 While there is a wide variety of French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines could be considered better for transport.
 Tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
 Australians consider the notion of "flat white" coffee to be foreign. A small, black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not served with milk.
 Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
 Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
 However, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay special attention to the security alerts.
 Cubomedusae are located near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this period.
 Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of people and would swim away.
 The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
 Booking accommodation in advance gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
 Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
 Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flights and accommodation.
 They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
 However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
 At some festivals, most of those attending the musical events decide to camp on the premises and most of the spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
 If you want to see the action up close, then you should arrive early to the campground to get a spot near the music events.
 It should be noted that while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival could continue until late at night.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as the ice-breaking noise is very annoying for those affected.
 During the cruises to St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
 Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money their customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
 They often offer special promotions on food, drink and entertainment in order to keep guests happy and on the premises.
 Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
 Anyone who intends to drive in high altitudes or mountain passes should plan for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
 On ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on bare asphalt.
 During snowstorms, the amount of snow that can fall can trap you in a very short time.
 In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow, or by condensation or ice that forms on the windows of the car.

 While they provide more stability to the rider, they can present safety issues, as it is possible for the rider's feet to get stuck in them.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, a series of safety precautions exist.
