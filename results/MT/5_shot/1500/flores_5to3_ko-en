 He is expected to run for President in 2016.
 According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
 This uses satellite-based technology, unlike the ground-based technology used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with very high accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
 In Wembley, additional transport is not provided or a surface train will not stop, and there is no surface parking or public transport interchange.
 Concerns over lack of public transportation made it likely that the game would be played without fans.
 Last Thursday, a study published in the science magazine announced that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
 Researchers at the U S . Princeton University and Sweden's Uppsala University found that the process took much longer,
 Gold can be worked in all kinds of shapes, even very small shapes.
 It can be sliced, curled, or twisted, it can be dug with a spade, or rolled with a sheet.
 Gold can be made very thin and can be attached to other metals,
 This is called the pH of a chemical, and it can be used to make a pH indicator.
 Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
 pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions in a chemical substance.
 Hydrogen ions are positively charged electrons.
 Dry two powders together, then wet with clean hands into a ball.
 The moisture in your hand reacts with the outer layer, forming a kind of shell.
 Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had sophisticated sewage systems connected to almost every house.
 Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Santorini and Crete, Minia,
 Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, too. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women used together.
 Thousands of miles away, talking to someone on a satellite.
 Satellites in space receive a signal and almost immediately reflect it back down.
 Satellites are launched into space with rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere of the earth distorts our light and our vision.
 To set up a satellite or a telescope in space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
 The wheel has changed the world, the greatest change being that it has provided us with a more convenient and faster means of transportation.
 It brought trains and cars and many other transportation modes.
 Underneath are medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, deer, and antelopes, and medium-sized goat-like animals.
 Finally, there are many smaller cats, such as pet cats,
 Their success formula is to block the competition of other cats, by exploiting a special niche, a specialty,
 Lions are the most social of all cats.
 A herd consists of one to three mature males,
 Females have a close relationship with each other because they are mostly raised in large extended families.
 Lion prides behave in similar ways to lions, but other large canids behave similarly, which is also deadly to prey.
 Tigers are like versatile athletes, able to run, swim, and leap five times the length of a human.
 Tigers, lions, panthers, and jaguars are the only four of these big cats that can roar.
 The roar of a tiger is different from a lion's roar, but it's similar to the phrase, yelling and screaming.
 Osellot enjoys a small animal, preferably one that is much smaller than himself, such as a monkey, snake, or a bird.
 Osellot uses its sense of smell to track and find animals it wants to eat.
 Ocelots are nocturnal, so they can see well in the dark, and move very cautiously.
 When a small group of organisms are separated from the main group from which they evolved,
 In these new environments, new resources and competitors exist, so new populations need different traits or adaptive strategies to survive.
 The original population had never changed at all, but still required the same adaptation.
 Over time, new people started to adapt to the new environment, and they started to look different from other people.
 Eventually, thousands or even millions of years later, the two groups would look so different that they could not be called the same species.
 We call this speciation, and it's a new species forming event that's inevitable and a key part of evolution.
 Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they consume the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
 Plants use photosynthesis to make their food and provide shade.
 We build houses with trees and clothe ourselves with plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetable. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 Mosasaurs were the top predators of their day, so nothing else was afraid of them.
 The jaws were filled with over seventy very sharp teeth, and these teeth were added to the incisor teeth, meaning that no one could pass by them.
 It's unclear, but it may have had a split tongue, eating turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even flesh.
 This animal attacked anything that went into the water, and it was as large as a Tyrannosaurus.
 Their food was largely familiar to us, but among the Roman people's banquet materials were some peculiar and strange things like pigs, wild boar, snails, and winter sleeping mice.
 Another difference is that poor people and women sat on chairs, while rich men preferred to recline on cushions.
 Ancient Roman meals could not include food that had come from Europe to the United States or Asia centuries later.
 For example, they ate no corn, tomato, potato, cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome tasted chicken.
 Babylonians built a main temple to their main God,
 People brought offerings to the gods, and priests tried to meet their demands through rituals and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only the priests could enter.
 Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called Zigurats were built to be part of a temple.
 The top of the tower is a special place for God.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
 The life of the Hebrew family was almost outdoors.
 Women cooked in the yard, shops were just stalls on the street, and stones were used to build houses.
 There were no great forests in Canaan,
 Greenland was sparsely settled. In Norwegian adventure tales, they say Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed further west, he named Greenland.
 regardless of his discovery the eskimo tribes were already there at that time
 Each country was part of Scandinavia, but Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had different Kings, customs, and histories.
 If you watched National Treasure, you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
 But, no, that's not true . Even if there's something written on the back of the paper, this is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it says,
 Who wrote it, no one knows, but this large parchment document (75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was preserved early on.
 So it's likely that it was simply labeled.
 The D-Day landings and the subsequent battle freed northern France, but the South remained free.
 There, the Vichy French were ruled by the Germans, who in 1940 had chosen to ally themselves with the invaders rather than fight them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded France,
 In just two weeks, the American and Free French armies had liberated France and were turning their attention to Germany.
 Civilization is a very large group of people working and living together, a single culture shared by a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin civitas, civis, meaning city or city state,
 Cities are the pioneers of civilization, culture, the preservation and fair distribution of knowledge over generations.
 A few cultures have no meaningful historical evidence and are not treated as proper civilizations.
 During the war, thirteen of the original states formed a central government with a weak executive, the only component of the Union under the Articles of Confederation.
 Congress had no power to tax, and there was no national executive or judicial branch, so often, to enforce laws, they had to rely on cooperative state authorities.
 The Congress had no power to nullify state laws or tariffs.
 These provisions required unanimous consent from all the states, and most of the state representatives ignored the central government.
 Italy's football team, along with Germany's football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, baseball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and sometimes Italian athletes compete in international games or the Olympics.
 Japan has nearly 7,000 Islands, making it the seventh largest Island in the world.
 Japan is often referred to as the Islands because of its cluster of Islands.
 Taiwan was named Ilha Formosa, or beautiful Island, by European sailors passing through the area in the 15th century.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India company set up a base in the Southwestern part of Taiwan, and began to employ Chinese laborers to grow rice and sugar cane.
 In 1683, the Qing dynasty's military seized the West and North coast of Taiwan and in 1885, it proclaimed Taiwan as a territory of the Qing dynasty.
 After defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war in 1894, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan and allowing it to rule the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu is comprised of three main structures, namely, the Intiwatana, the temple of the sun, and three windows.
 Most of the buildings located on the edge are reconstructed to better understand the original appearance.
 In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the world's most common still image format, 35 mm, was the film size used mainly at the end of the analog film era.
 It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by Digital camera image sensor formats.
 A little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
 So the aspect ratio of this format, which is the simplest integer ratio to get, is 3:2.
 Many common formats, such as APS format, are identical or nearly identical to this ratio.
 The three-thirds rule, often derided and overused, is a simple guideline for maintaining order while creating dynamism.
 This rule states that the most effective position for a major subject is the point where the vertical and horizontal lines intersect.
 This period of European history saw the Catholic Church thoroughly investigated.
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity bound European nations together despite language and customary differences.
 Its prevalence reaches all men, from King to peasant.
 One of the main teachings of Christianity is that money is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's tithing fund exists for just such a reason.
 The church's core power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this imbalance of power and money raised questions about the legitimacy of this doctrine.
 Immediately after the war began, the United Kingdom began a sea blockade of Germany.
 Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law,
 Britain had not allowed any ships to enter the entire zone, thus putting even neutral ships at risk.
 The response to this tactic was limited,
 In the 1920s, the prevailing mood in most cities and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
 Through World War I, countries that had experienced the horrors of war in the past prayed that such a situation would never happen again.

 In ancient China, there were different ways of representing each era, or dynasty, in Chinese history.
 There were also several divisions between each dynasty, the most well-known being the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms era.
 During this time, there was a fierce war among many nobles who were vying for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms era was one of the most bloody in Chinese history, with thousands of people dying to sit in the highest seats of power in Xi'An.
 The meter system, the shift from absolutism to a Republic, and the idea that nationalism and the state are the property of many, not one ruler, had a huge impact on society and politics.
 After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, opening the way for the most ambitious and success-oriented people to succeed.
 Instead of a hierarchy based on current ability,
 The French Revolution also inspired the working class, who were oppressed in many other countries, to rise up and fight for their own revolution.
 Muhammad was deeply concerned with issues beyond this worldly life.
 The winds of time have weathered the cave,
 At the top of one of the mountains in the middle of Mecca,
 In fact, even knowing that it exists, it's hard to find, because once you're in the cave, it's complete isolation.
 Surrounded by a clear, beautiful sky, nothing but this cave can be seen or heard.
 The journalist's pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists.
 Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the great pyramid was one of many huge pyramid structures built to honour the dead Pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, contains several pyramids,
 The great pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Kufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Kufu's wives and family.
 The Olympic symbol is a V-shaped stylized circle,
 Olympic began with the archer, and Olympic ended with the archer.

 You can make your own markings with pencil, but the bow markings are for musical purposes only, so they are usually kept.
 The terrified King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children, Marie Therese, age eleven, and Louis Charles, age four,
 The King and the Queen rode in a carriage surrounded by crowds who shouted and threatened them.
 The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows.
 At one point, a member of the Royalist police,
 The Philippines used American imperialism to pay for the Philippines war.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U S . colonial government in order to pay back a substantial portion of their loans, and the Philippines government's name was used to attract interest.
 Of course, the long-term super-profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the basic profit of U.S. imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, you have to understand the Creation-Order.
 The time of the incident is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, which is the period of European history from the eleventh to the thirteenth century.
 Late medievalism, the period following the high Middle Ages, is traditionally considered to end around the year 1500.

 Most interpretations of Technological Determinism have two concepts, that Technological development itself has a social influence,
 For example, someone might argue that cars led to the development of roads.
 But a national road network is inefficient economically, since few cars would use it.
 Owning a vehicle also increases the road accident rate, which in turn leads to new technologies to repair damaged bodies.
 Romanticism had many elements of cultural determinism, influenced by authors such as Goethe, Schiller, and Schleiermacher.
 In romanticism, geography formed each individual, time grew, and the geography-related customs and culture grew, which was socially harmonious, and eventually it was better than arbitrarily making laws and imposing them.
 Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 The center of luxury began in the year 400, and lasted until the year 1100.
 Constantinople's status had fallen in the twelfth century, mainly because Crusaders brought back goods that were more valuable than the Byzantine market, such as silk and spices.
 At this time, the fashion capital was Constantinople,
 Gothic style peaked in the 10th to 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
 In the early days, dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
 But information exchange was slow, so Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
 Late medieval Europe began to develop its own style, one of the greatest developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture that specializes in producing only the amount of food necessary to sustain the farmer and his family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple, organic system that uses local, native seeds to maximize harvest.
 Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and still do in many developing nations.
 Subcultures allow similar people to form their own identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, position and or gender.
 A Subculture is defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, and other factors.
 Members of a subculture often identify with a unique and symbolic style, including fashion, mannerisms, and specific slang.
 One of the most common ways to use neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse as a reason for not socializing is to use the case of a few unfortunate children who were not socialized by adults.
 These children are called feral, some feral children are even caged, in a few cases, this child abuse is caused by parents not accepting their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
 Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
 Some children are said to be raised by animals, some children are said to have lived wild themselves.
 When animals are completely raised by humans, wild animals behave almost entirely like special care animals,
 Project-Based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding takes it one step further.
 Scaffolding is a form of teaching, but it's more like a coach, using the latest computer program or helping someone learn something new.
 VR can be both virtual and real, and in other words, a teacher is a form of VR, but a little paper clip human.
 Virtual structure is built into software and is meant to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
 The reasons why a child is placed in foster care vary widely, from neglect to abuse, even to kidnapping.
 All children need a nurturing, protective, and educational environment.
 We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
 Our foster care system will provide a safe home, a nurturing babysitter, a stable education, and reliable health care.
 Family foster care should be able to provide all essential factors that were not met in the existing family.
 The Internet has both a collective and a person-to-person communication factor.
 The Internet's distinctive access approach leads to additional dimensions in the use and satisfaction dimension.
 For example, learning and socialization were cited as important motivators for Internet use.
 Amey and MacCord (1998) found that personal involvement and continuing relationship were new motivating aspects.
 Video recording allowed us to make important discoveries in the interpretation of microscopic facial movements that lasted only a few milliseconds.
 In particular, they argue that it can accurately detect whether a person is lying or not.
 Oliver Sacks noted in his book, the President's Speech, that people accurately perceived the sincerity of the man,
 He even suggests that these same abilities are also possessed by pet dogs.
 Two hidden or apparent genetic groups,
 Mutations create new genes, and selection removes expressed genes from the pool.
 Separation and Recombination mix up the variations that occur between each generation.
 In the savannah, it's hard for primates with human-like digestive systems to get the amino acid they need from available plant resources.
 failure to do this results in serious consequences leading to growth failure, malnutrition and eventually death.
 The easiest plant source to access is the leaves or proteins from legumes, but these are hard for us, the great apes, to Digest.
 In contrast, ants, termites, and eggs provide high quality proteins, not only easily digested,
 Considering all the circumstances, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep disturbance is a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes) after intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period.
 This is to wake you up completely, not to wake you up with a comparatively quiet alarm clock.
 If you turn off the alarm clock in the far corner,
 Other biological rhythm-based options include forcing the patient to consume a large amount of water, especially water or a diuretic, before bedtime.
 The amount of calmness a person has is related to the amount of anxiety that is internalized in his body and soul.
 The less tension, the more positive energy will be created in your life.
 Anyone can attain enlightenment, the only obstacle to this goal is our inner anxiety and negative tendencies.
 Tibetan Buddhism, based on the teachings of the Buddha, expanded based on the love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
 Tibetan Buddhism is, in theory, very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces all.
 Kundalini yoga, through the yoga postures, breathing exercises, Mantra, and visualization,
 At the center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, visualizing various deities to cleanse energy channels, activate chakras, and create enlightenment.
 In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and this led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
 Two years later, the former allies became enemies, and the cold war began.
 The cold war would last for the next forty years and would be a real fight by proxy in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
 On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
 However, these plans were rendered useless when over 800,000 Soviet Army soldiers invaded Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, almost overnight,
 Shipping goods by sea is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
 Traditionally, the Navy's mission has been to transport people and goods, but at the same time, to hinder the enemy from transporting people and goods.
 One of the most notable recent cases was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which Americans tried to move manpower and resources across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy, which used U-Boats primarily, tried to block this operation.
 If the Allies had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain, just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
 Sheep and goat raising began about a million years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
 Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them to easily use milk, wool, meat, and leather.
 Sheep and goats are generally herded in groups, often by children or teenage shepherds, known as boy shepherds.
 The chaise was built in England in the early sixteenth century.
 Machado was made of parallel wooden planks, but, nevertheless, it allowed horses to go faster and carry more loads.
 Timber was used early to fix rails, but it was found that rails on iron ties were more efficient.
 This became a general practice, but iron made the wooden wheels of chariots more liable to wear out.
 Time went on, and wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767, the first railroad was introduced.
 The first transportation known to humanity was walking, two million years ago, when Homo Erectus came into being.
 Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright like them.
 Sahlan's footprints may have been bipedal, but the features of bipedal walking are well represented in the footprints of Australopithecus, which date from 420 to 390 million years ago.
 We can start to live a more environmentally friendly life, and we can also become activists to reduce the pain we will face in the future.
 This is similar in many cases to symptomatic treatment, but if you want to find the root of the problem, you have to find and disable that part.
 It's obvious that the world has changed a lot, and it's also obvious that the problem is getting worse because of overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
 On July 4, the Congress, after adopting it, sent a single copy, signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the Secretary, to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
 That night, now known as the Dunn lab, printed 150 to 200 sheets.
 On July 8, the document was first read aloud by John Nixon in the Independence Memorial.
 One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his own troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
 Twenty-five Dunnlap broadsides are known to exist, the oldest surviving copy of this document.
 Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
 Many people do not think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But still, there are many things that make dinosaurs look like birds.
 They have scales on their toes, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs like T-Rex.
 Most computers used today use a method of information manipulation called Binary Coding.
 Binary numbers can have only one of two values, or bits, as computer experts call them.
 Internal poisoning may not have symptoms at all, symptoms like vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
 The most certain sign of poisoning is a container that looks like a medicine or household chemical that's been left open.
 Check for specific emergency instructions for that specific poison.
 The term bugle is used by entomologists to refer to these kinds of insects.
 This term was originally coined from a parasitic insect, the Vinde,
 Cinnamon and vinegar are both chronic pests, adapting to their host's or their home's habitat.
 Multiple sclerosis, the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults, affects about 400,000 people across the United States.
 Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and the nerves that make up the central nervous system.
 Women are two times more likely to get multiple sclerosis than men.
 couples may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have a baby they may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have a baby
 These couples may choose to adopt a baby.
 In the adoption process, other couples give up their parental rights.
 The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works, and this method has led to most of the scientific research.
 But experimentation is to eliminate one or more hypotheses, to ask questions, to lead to scientific research.
 Scholars and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
 Aristotle's view of all matter was accepted in science, including psychology.
 As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West became disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
 Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend critically on the existence of an internal clock.
 Bacteria, fungi, plants and most living organisms, including humans, have a rhythmic pattern of activity,
 The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that can continue to tick without any external cues.
 Hersh and Chase's experiment was one of the leading researches that suggested DNA was a genetic material.
 Hersch and Chase used Phage, or viruses, to insert bacteria into their DNA.
 They did two experiments, one to identify DNA in the Parasite,
 Mutations can vary in kind, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or somatic cells.
 Mutations in the reproductive cell can only be passed on to the child, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
 Natural tourism includes the scenery for people interested in nature tourism to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wild animals.
 Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and research into parks and ecosystems.
 Borneo's Orangutan, for instance,
 Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to go to work, passing other people who just left their jobs.
 This dynamic shuttle would connect and support everyone's car-based transportation system in some way.
 Now, scientific data show that this giant carbon economy has pushed the biosphere into a state that has helped human evolution for the last two hundred million years.
 Everyone participates in the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
 In advanced countries, there are few complaints of similar levels of bridge collapse or water quality issues.
 Why does the transport system generate such frustration, and why do transport engineers all seem incompetent?
 Traffic flow is a study of the individual driver and vehicle interactions and how they interact with each other.
 Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior can't be predicted 100% of the time.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range, so traffic flow has a reasonable degree of mathematical representation.
 To better represent the flow of traffic, three key characteristics were set between flow, density, and speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back.
 This allows them to provide a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
 Today, there are only two insects that cannot fold their wings, the moth and the fly.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 Some people believed that he was right, including harm, who believed that the solar system, including the earth, rotated around the sun.
 It feels like the earth is not moving,
 The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river in the world.
 Amazon is also the world's largest river, sometimes as wide as six miles.
 Twenty percent of the water that flows into the ocean from the earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
 The Amazon River is six thousand three hundred and eighty seven miles long.
 Until the last moments of the Old Kingdom, pyramid construction went on,
 The ancient New Kingdom Egyptians were awed by their ancestors' monumental buildings, and this was a building that was over 1,000 years old by their standards.
 The Vatican city state has a population of about eight hundred people, the world's smallest independent nation and the world's least populated country.
 The Vatican City State uses Italian for legislative and official communications.
 Italian, on the other hand, unlike the Latin used in religious ceremonies, is the everyday language of most of the people who work in the country.
 All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
 People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper, and others, all of which can be found in their natural state and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
 Aristotle theorized that all matter was composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 This was similar to the four states of matter, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but Aristotle also created a theory that they were new Substances,
 Alloys are basically two or more metals mixed together.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, of course, just like gold and silver.
