 For example, the most common still image format in the world, which is 35 mm,
 It's still produced today, but more importantly, it's been adapted to the image sensor format of Digital cameras.
 But it's a little bit confusing, because the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
 So the aspect ratio of this format, which is the simplest integer ratio to get, is 3:2.
 Several common formats, such as the APS format, are identical or nearly identical to this aspect ratio.
 The rule of thirds is often used and often derided as a simple rule to maintain the order of an image while creating dynamism.

 In the developed world, we rarely hear about infrastructure problems like bridge collapses.
 Why does the transportation system cause such a grievance, and why does it keep on disappointing us every day?
 Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move and interact with each other.
 Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict the driver's behavior 100% of the time.

 This gives us a lot of information and data to help us build a simulation model that will help us to understand the inner workings of the mind.
 AI, though, strongly evokes science fiction, but it's a very important area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of computers.
 AI research includes the study of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 For example, writing, voice, face recognition, of course, control, planning, scheduling, and customer diagnostics and answering questions.
 These things have become a separate discipline, focusing on solving problems that arise in everyday life.
 AI systems are now being used in many different areas, such as economics, health care, engineering, and the military.
