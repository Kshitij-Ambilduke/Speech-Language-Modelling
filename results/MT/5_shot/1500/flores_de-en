 The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
 The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
 Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported, resulting in six house fires and four people suffering minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that it had been notified of 27 incidents involving the devices.
 Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by apple of 34 additional cases of Overheating, which the company described as not being serious.
 The Ministry reacted by describing the delay in the report's release as being a real disappointment.
 The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a M. local time,
 The office of the northern Marianas's Department of Homeland Security said no damage was reported.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
 A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
 Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
 Several hostages were rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
 Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers took the place of an older lady as she went to the toilet, and Mendoza was shot.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
 He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labour in his spare time.
 His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two black box flight recorders.
 Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said, quote, Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme.
 Dustin Runnels commented, Luna was just as crazy as me,
 Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 Federal election, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a Republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
 The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 Federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a Republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
 Thirty four percent of those surveyed agree with this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
 Twenty nine percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, while thirty one percent said Australia should never become a Republic.
 The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle events, as well as three relay events, but his fitness was questioned due to a number of injuries.
 He was unable to take the required medication to overcome his pain, as it was banned at the Commonwealth Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
 Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets may have been a source of the earth's water supply, along with organic matter that could form proteins and make life possible.
 Since comets have been known to collide with the earth in the past, scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, especially the earth, form.
 Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
 He dismissed the rumors as political gossip and nonsense.
 It is speculated that he may run for the office of President in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
 It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to enable the air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide the pilots with more accurate information.
 No additional transportation is being provided, and the surface trains will not be stopping at Wembley.
 With the concern of lacking transportation, the possibility grew that the game would have to be played without the fans of the team.
 A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
 Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within only two generations, although previously it had been thought that this would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
 It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven, hammered, or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin and stuck onto other metal it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called miniatures, in books, which are called miniatures.
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
 The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how sour or basic the chemical is.
 The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions in the tested chemicals.
 Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been stripped.
 Mix the two dry powders together and then form them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels kind of weird and creates a kind of protective layer.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
 And the remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women visited in mixed company.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down to the ground.
 The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
 It takes a giant rocket with a height of over one hundred feet to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
 The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way.
 It has brought us the railroad, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
 Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small cats, including stray house cats, which prey on much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with others.
 Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
 Women normally have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions, but not to other big cats.
 As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb, although not particularly well, swim, jump great distances, and pull with the strength of five men.
 The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, which are the only four cats that can roar.
 The tiger's roar does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growled words.
 Ocelots eat small animals, and if they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
 Scientists think that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and hunt prey.
 They can see in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
 If a small group of living things, a small population, is separated from the main population, from which it came,
 And the other thing is that we're now in a new environment,
 The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, two populations may look so different that they cannot be assigned to the same species.
 We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
 Plants generate oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
 Plants produce their food through photosynthesis, and they also give shade.
 We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants, we eat mainly from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasauruses.
 His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus a further set on the palate, which meant that no creature could escape if it crossed his path.
 We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, and he ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even ate some of his own kind.
 He also grabbed everything that came into the water, even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex.
 While the majority of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of odd or unusual festive meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called a SiebenschlÃ¤fer.
 Another difference was that the poorer people and women ate their food sitting on stools, while the richer men preferred to have joint banquets,
 The courts of ancient Rome could not include foods that came from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
 They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no old Roman had ever tasted a Turkey.
 The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the House of the God.
 They brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to appease the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar room that only priests were allowed to enter.
 Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temple.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the God.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not become as large.
 The largest part of the Hebrew family's life played outdoors.
 The women cooked in the yard. Businesses consisted of open-air shops, and stone was used for housebuilding.
 In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the old Norse Sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder.
 But, independent of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
 Although all the countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, the Kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you've seen the movie, the Mummy, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 Although on the back of the document, something is written, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words, original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776, are written upside down.
 No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the great parchment document, which measures 29Â¾ inches by 24Â½ inches, was rolled up at the beginning of its life.
 It is possible, therefore, that the remark was added simply as a label.
 The landing at D-Day and the ensuing battles freed northern France, but the South was still not free.
 He was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called operation Dragoon.
 After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had freed the South of France and turned their attention to Germany.
 A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state.
 City-States are the precursors of nations, a civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a proper distribution.
 Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical records and fail to be recognized as a real civilization.
 During the revolutionary wars, the thirteen states formed a weak central government, which consisted only of the Congress.
 The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or national judiciary,
 He also had no power to suspend or repeal state tax laws.
 The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives often were absent.
 The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
 Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, Rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic games.
 Japan has approximately 7,000 Islands, making it the seventh largest Island in the world.
 Because of the cluster of Islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an Archipelago.
 The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 1624 the Dutch East India company founded a settlement in the Southwest of Taiwan, thereby leading a change in the rice cultivation methods of the aboriginals and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, Qing dynasty forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing dynasty.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki,
 Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the sun temple, and the room of the three windows.
 Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
 However, by 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues today.
 For example, the most widely used film format is 35 mm, which is the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
 It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the image sensor formats of Digital cameras.
 In fact, the 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
 The aspect ratio of this format, divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio, is therefore referred to as 3:2.
 Many common formats, like the APS format family, for example, have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
 The much-maligned and often derided thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time, keeps a measure of order in a picture.
 It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif.
 In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was on trial.
 For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European States together, despite different languages and customs.
 His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the King to the lowest citizen.
 One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that it is the money of the churches that exists for this very purpose.
 The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been adhered to.
 Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
 The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole seas, which was a danger to neutral ships as well as to the enemy.
 Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted U-Boat warfare.
 In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
 After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the first World War, nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison company in New York City.
 He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor,
 The old China had a unique method of displaying different eras, each time period in China and each family that was in power, was a dynasty.
 Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable periods of divided provinces, the best-known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
 In those days, there were bitter wars among many nobles who fought for the throne.
 The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest throne in the great Palace of Xi'an.
 There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism to Republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a ruler.
 Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
 The same is true of the military, for instead of class rankings based on class,
 The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira, on the mountain of Nur,
 The cave itself has outlived the times and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
 The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 Indeed, it is quite difficult to find, even though one knows it exists,
 You see nothing but the overlying, clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains from the interior of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
 The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
 Built in the third century B.C. by the Egyptians, the Cheops pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures that were built to worship the dead Pharaohs.
 The Giza plateau, or Giza necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, comprises several pyramids, including the great pyramid, several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
 The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops's wives and family members.
 The slash symbol looks like a V, and the dash symbol looks like a K.
 Upwards means that you start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you start at the frog, which is where your hand holds the bow, and you pull the bow.
 The brush stroke generates a softer tone, while the stroke of the brush is stronger and more expressive.
 You can add your own pencil markings, but please remember that the printed sheet markings are there for a reason.
 The panicked King Louis the fourteenth, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children,
 They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were shouting threats against the King and the Queen.
 The mob forced the King and the queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
 At some point, a member of the enraged crowd swung the head of a King's-Guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
 The war expenses of the U S . Imperialists in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U S . colonial regime in order to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from the bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
 Of course, the super profits, which came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people, were the basic gains of U S . imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
 The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the high Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
 The early Middle Ages followed the early Middle Ages, which in turn were followed by the late Middle Ages.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technology push or the technological imperative,
 The most common interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas, one, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the realm of cultural or political influence,
 One could argue that the automobile is inevitably linked to the development of roads.
 However, a nationwide road network is economically not viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
 The widespread automobile ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health care industry to repair damaged bodies.
 The Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals, with the time, customs and cultures that arose with reference to this geography, and these, as they were in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily oktroyierte Gesetze.
 So, like Paris is the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
 His status declined during the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered to be of greater value than the Byzantine markets.
 At this time, the title of fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries,
 At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
 In the West, however, styles lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, West Europe began to develop its own style, one of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 Farming is the production of food, fiber, and other goods by a person or organization to provide for their own needs.
 The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological, form of agriculture that uses saved, locally grown seed and combines it with rotational crop or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
 In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, that is still the case.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures may be defined in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
 The characteristics that distinguish a Subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these.
 Members of a Subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon.
 One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on a few unfortunate cases of children who have been neglected, abused, or neglected and abused.
 Some of these children were captured by humans, usually their own parents, and in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
 Wolf-Kidnapped children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
 Some were raised by animals, some lived alone in the wilderness.
 If it has been completely raised by animals, the wild child will show behavioral traits that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caretaker, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
 While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, Scaffolding goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a method of teaching, but rather a support that helps individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project.
 Scaffolding can be virtual as well as real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little office clamp in Microsoft office.
 Virtual assistance is built into the software and is supposed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone might not be able to accomplish.
 Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and from coercion to extortion.
 No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education oriented, but many are.
 For us, the system of residential care is a piece of security for these children.
 Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
 The foster home is supposed to meet all the needs that the child had in the home from which they were removed.
 The Internet connects elements of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
 The specificities of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
 For example, learning and socialization are cited as important motivations for Internet use.
 Personal engagement and ongoing relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998),
 The use of Video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of Microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few Milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in the person's facial expression.
 In his article, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who, because of a brain injury, no longer understand language, can still correctly gauge the honesty of others.
 He even argues that the ability to interpret human behaviour is shared with animals like dogs.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation,
 Mutation provides new genetic variations, and selection removes these from the pool of expressed Variations.
 Segregation and Recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation,
 Out in the Savanna, it's tough for a primate with a gut like ours to get its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
 And it has serious consequences if you don't do it: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
 The easiest available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
 In contrast, animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are not only easily digested, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids.
 In summary, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the Savanna do today.
 And the process of waking up during normal sleep periods and then falling asleep shortly after.
 This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to gently wake you up without fully waking you.
 If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Another biorhythm-based possibility is to drink a lot of liquid before bedtime, especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect,
 The degree of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
 The less tension, the more positive the life force is, and every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way of this is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
 With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, Mantras, and visualization.
 At the center of Tibetan meditation is the Guru-Yoga,
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course of events, and culture led to the countries' estrangement.
 Two years after the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the cold war began.
 He should have been in the next 40 years and in reality, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
 On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was in a retreat and a reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans, however, became almost obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 Soviet Army troops entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
 The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
 The Navy's traditional role has been to ensure that a nation remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time, preventing the enemy from doing so.
 One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during the second World War, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with U-Boats.
 Had the Allies failed, Germany would have conquered Britain,
 Goats were apparently already domesticated in the Zagros mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
 Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock, to get easily at their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
 Normally, the goats were kept in herds that wandered around on hills or other grazing areas.
 In the sixteenth century, England had already built tramways.
 Although the track consisted of parallel wooden boards, it allowed the horses which drew the wagons to travel at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
 Soon, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails, but it was soon realized that rails, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient.
 This became the norm, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Finally, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails, and in 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
 The first known way of getting around was walking,
 Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
 Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
 We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate some of the future's pain.
 In many cases, that's just like a symptomatic treatment, but if you want to get to the root of the problem, then we should find and treat the root cause.
 It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans have become much more serious.
 After its adoption by the Congress on July fourth, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing press of John Dunlap.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were made over the course of the night, and are today known as the Dunlap broadsides.
 The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of independence hall on the 8th of July.
 One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
 The 25 Dunlap-Broadside copies that are still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
 Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today.
 Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
 They have feet with claws and lay eggs, and they walk on both their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
 Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is coded in the form of Binary numbers.
 A Binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as Binary digits, or Bits, to use the computer jargon.
 An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, the symptoms, for example, vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
 The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic household chemicals.
 Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
 The term Wasp is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
 This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable in their ability to parasitize humans.
 Both bedbugs and Raubwanzen are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the most widespread neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
 Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
 A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to raise a baby.
 These couples may choose to adopt a baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can assume parental rights.
 The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works.
 But it's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
 Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, and in particular on the Bible in the Latin language.
 Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the loss of Greek language, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
 Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
 Behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from the outside are known in most living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals will run a rhythm for a time.
 The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used Phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They took two experiments, in which they either tagged the Phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or tagged a protein in the Phage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what the significance of the piece of genetic material is, and whether it's in the germ line or not.
 Only Mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while Mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
 Nature-Based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
 Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
 An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to work, and are passed by others whose workplace is at the very spot they have just left.
 In this dynamic pendulum, all are in some way connected to and supporting a transport system based on the private car.
 The science now points out that this massive carbon-based economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states,
 Everyone participates in the society and uses transportation systems.
 In developed countries, you'll rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
 Why do transportation systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
 Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
 Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, since one cannot predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a somewhat consistent manner, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented by mathematics.
 To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined as follows: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
 These relationships help with the planning, designing, and operation of facilities at the roadway.
 Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky, and their ability to fly helped them to escape predators and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
 And because of this, they have a wider selection of small hiding places in which to escape from predators.
 Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system.
 Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the sun, the planets, and even the stars, were all moving around the earth.
 That seems reasonable, since it doesn't appear to us that the earth is moving.
 The Amazon is the second longest and the second-most water-rich river in the world, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest.
 The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes as wide as six miles.
 As much as twenty percent of the water that flows into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
 The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers long,
 Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom,
 Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
 The Vatican City has approximately 800 residents, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
 The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
 Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of Vatican city are Roman Catholic.
 Basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as these all can be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
 Aristotle, a philosopher, put forth the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
 This corresponded more to the four Aggregate States (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
 Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
 There are also alloys which contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
 The universe consists of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
 Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been pushed into the background in its status and in its use.
 Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter.
 One may be curious to see what will emerge from the keyboard when something newer comes along.
 The atomic bomb relies on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
 This is like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, and when the core is split again, some of that energy is released.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will decay at the slightest or even no provocation.
 The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust, the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
 The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
 It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highland.
 On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 In-depth theories focus on finding what moves and appeals to people.
 These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood.
 These theories concern themselves with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
 In general, there are two ways in which managers may begin to lead their former colleagues.
 This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance assessments, allocating responsibilities and holding employees to account.
 At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes a non-recognizable individual who has to change everything the team has done and take ownership of everything.
 Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
 This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
 Virtual team members often serve as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may be located in different time zones that are not considered by the local leadership.
 The presence of a real invisible team is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 The invisible team is the leadership team to which every member reports.
 Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization?
 When all the available resources are effectively utilized across all the departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can flourish.
 In the end, the collective work of an organization can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs.
 Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more performance-oriented.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby defining the field and making it much more precise.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that various kinds of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
 Emerging Technologies are allowing us to see and to explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
 This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our head.
 KI, though strongly associated with science fiction, is a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
 Research in the field of ai includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Examples of this include steering, setting up strategies and timelines, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
 Such things have become their own disciplines, concentrating on finding solutions to real-life problems.
 The ai system is today often used in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is also built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
 Excursions are an important part of every school class, and not infrequently a teacher would like to take her or his pupils to places which are not accessible by bus.
 Virtual field trips are a technological solution whereby students can view museum pieces, visit an Aquarium, or view works of art from the comfort of their classroom.
 A virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, every year, students at Bennet high school in North Carolina design a Website about their trip to the state capital.
 Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students, although at the beginning of their Blogging experience,
 Since students are often a very critical audience, the Blog author tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
 Blogging, he writes, also forces the students to learn more about the world around them.
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
 The appropriate use of Blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical,
 Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is marked by a range of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
 Further south are the Niagara falls, and to the North, the untouched beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
 All of these things and more make Ontario stand out as what outsiders consider to be typically Canadian.
 There are large areas further north that are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 A population comparison that many will find surprising: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
 The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the East Coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a continent unto itself.
 Most of the smaller Islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.

 Stay consistent when you reject men and don't be afraid to defend your position,
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
 The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
 Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
 Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan wares like tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of Tinnef are sold, but that's only for the tourists.
 Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far East near Ruanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the town center, under itself.
 While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
 The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
 You can use Bodabodas, which are motorcycle taxis, to get around Goma. The usual price is around 500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
 This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has led to Timbuktu being used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
 Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor town.
 In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
 It was one of the most important stops on Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
 The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arabic than an African feel.
 The Kruger National Park lies in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the North, and the Crocodile River to the South.
 The park has an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal world.
 He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks.
 Like all South African national parks, it charges a daily conservation fee.
 It may also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National parks.
 Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory Hong Kong and stands at the center of many tourists' attention.
 The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering Balkendiagram that becomes visible through the presence of the Victoria Harbour's waters.
 For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and take a ferry to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
 The majority of Hong Kong Island's urbanization is dense and packed along the North Coast.
 This is the site of the British colonial past, and if you're looking for traces of the colonial past, this is a good place to start.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, and extend 80 kilometers from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
 The Sundarbans were designated a UNESCO world heritage site, and the part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests, however, are not just Mangrove swamps they also contain some of the last remaining patches of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
 The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
 The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station,

 The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction works were completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was only in March 2017.
 The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, and it is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will be completed by then.
 The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the present-day East Paraguay.
 The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the GuaycurÃº and the PayaguÃ¡, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
 Paraguay, formerly called the great province of West Indies, originated in the 16th century as a result of the Spanish conquerors meeting the indigenous groups.
 The Spanish began a three-century-long period of colonization.
 Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.

 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound, whose value is pegged to that of the British pound.
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
 The British pound is basically accepted everywhere on the Islands and at Stanley, and U S . dollars are also frequently accepted.
 On the remote Islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U S . currency may be accepted, so inquire in advance with the owners of the property which method of payment is accepted.
 It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the Islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before you leave the Islands.
 Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months, temperatures of over 30 Â°C are common.

 The cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies were not going to apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to be held.
 It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
 Drying wet clothes can help them to dry faster, and many hotels provide ironing boards and irons, even if you are not in the room.
 If no iron is available, or one does not wish to wear ironed socks, one can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
 Be careful the fabric doesn't get too hot, or it may shrink or cause burns.
 There are several different ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective than others in dealing with certain contaminants.
 In some areas, it takes only a minute to boil water, in others, it takes several minutes.
 The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
 Travellers may encounter animal pests that they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
 Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
 Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
 Duty-Free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from duties and taxes at certain locations.

 With a selection of 17,000 Islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 But when used without further attributes, the term generally refers to the food that originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 Today, the cuisine of Java is widespread throughout the Indonesian archipelago,
 The stirrups are aids for the feet of the rider, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
 They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
 If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse continues to run.
 First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
 In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled from a rider who falls.
 The CochamÃ³ Valley, Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large Granite walls and cliffs.

 Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where one attaches skis or a snowboard to their feet and rides down a slope.
 Skiing is a popular recreational activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski penny, who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular resort.
 The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings with depictions of skiers date back to 5000 BC.
 The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
 Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
 It is similar to alpine touring, but does not necessarily include it, as alpine touring is done in steep terrain and requires much firmer ski and boot.
 Consider the ski route like a comparable hiking route.
 In good conditions, you're able to cover somewhat larger distances than when hiking, but you'll rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy rucksack.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries, and it is normal to have to apply for visas and to go through several passport controls when travelling through several countries.
 The Schengen area, however, works a little bit like a country in this regard.
 As long as you remain in this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
 You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen Member States, which saves you time, money and bureaucracy.
 There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as objects over 100 years old.
 The definition has geographic deviations, where the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
 Handmade products could be described as antique, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
 Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the SÃ¡mi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
 Also in the past, not all SÃ¡mi have raised reindeer, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar.
 Today, many SÃ¡mi work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in SÃ¡pmi, the SÃ¡mi region.
 Even though the term ""Zigeuner"" is used primarily by Non-Roma, it is often perceived as being offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
 If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 You can also consult the advice of other governments, but whose advice is only for their own citizens.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 The briefings are only a short summary of the political situation in a country.
 The views presented are often superficial, general and, in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere,
 Weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or the loss of human life.
 Weather can occur anywhere on the planet, and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
 Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
 Travellers are urged to watch out for any type of severe weather that may affect their travel plans.
 Everyone who plans to travel to a war zone should get professional training.
 A Google search for a course on hostile environments will likely bring up the address of a local firm.
 A course will cover all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
 A course is usually between two and five days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
 There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but only a few publications on war zones.
 Travellers who are planning to have a gender reassignment surgery overseas must ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.

 Transgender people should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when they pass through the scanners.
 Rip currents are the returning tide of waves that break on the shore, often at reefs or similar structures.
 Because of the underwater topography, the outflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a swift current can form there.
 Most deaths occur from exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
 When you get out of the current, it's not as hard to swim back as it would be in a normal situation.
 Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught, or, if you've been spotted, maybe wait for rescue.
 The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock, and lasts longer.
 It is easy for those who adapt easily to the new culture, but it is sometimes very hard for them to adapt again to their own culture.
 When you come back from a foreign country, you have adapted to a different culture and dropped some of your home country's behavior.
 When you first traveled abroad, the people were probably patient and understanding because they knew travelers have to adjust to a new place.
 One might not expect that even returning travelers would need patience and understanding.
 The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark, and while it's quiet, before the show begins.
