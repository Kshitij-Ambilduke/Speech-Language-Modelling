 Even though the administration of an antibody cocktail, ZMapp, had initially shown promising signs on the ground, formal studies have shown that its ability to limit deaths did not live up to expectations.
 In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
 The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
 We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, would be better served by moving forward and making meaningful changes to our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
 USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse described so courageously by Larry Nassar’s survivors could go unchecked for so long and will adopt any necessary and appropriate changes.
 USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
 Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an adviser, then for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
 During the 1976 primaries, he advised Carter on foreign policy, then served as national security adviser from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

 This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 Scientists say the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
 This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Since dinosaur feathers did not have a fully developed stem, called a rachis, but still showed other features typical of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development later than these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for regulation or temperature display. The researchers suggested that, even though it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy feathers of a chick.
 The scientists say that this is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult, not a young.
 A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
 The governor's office said 19 of the wounded were police officers.
 Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh militant as the suspect behind the attack.
 They found that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
 Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flux.
 As for magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

 He added, however, that “we should not ask them to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their responsibility and their capacities.”
 The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
 He warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this stage will end sectarian war, growing violence or the slide towards chaos.
 The report opens with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.
 The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the government's current policy towards Iraq and strongly argues for an immediate change of direction.
 The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

 The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
 The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
 Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
 Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
 According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

 Dr Tony Moll discovered multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
 "In an interview, he said the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
 Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll said, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
 Over a one-year period, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
 However, the percentage of TB-UR in the overall group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 were infected at some point in South Africa.

 Several million vials of vaccine against encephalitis have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
 Delivery plans for vaccines in the areas hardest hit this year have been delayed due to a lack of funding and a low priority for these diseases compared to others.
 In 1956, Słania settled in Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish Post, eventually becoming its chief engraver.
 He produced more than 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
 His work is of such quality and level of detail that he is one of the few well-known philatelists of the "general public". Some collectors devote their attention only to his works.
 Its one-thousandth stamp was the magnificent “Great Deeds by Swedish Kings” by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in 2000, which is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records.
 He has also engraved banknotes for many countries. Among his recent work, one can mention the portraits of the Prime Minister on the recto of the new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.

 All the entrances to the caves, which have been dubbed “The Seven Sisters,” are at least 100 to 250 meters in diameter.
 Infrared images reveal, due to the variations in temperature during the day and night, that these are probably caves.
 “They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.”
 "Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves of the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS crew and staff of the University of Arizona North in Flagstaff, Arizona.
 In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters seal themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed paper ballot in an envelope, and drop it in a box.
 After the officers verify his identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter registration card.
 The French electoral code regulates operations quite strictly.
 Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
 Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

 Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We have arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
 The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said the accused had their faces covered when they appeared before the court.
 Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
 However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
 The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
 He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was then transferred to Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital.
 Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
 She is being held in custody pending her trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her picture has been widely circulated.
 It is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts considered that publishing the photos would be potentially prejudicial.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photos etc of suspects”.
 The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made until the indictment.
 According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
 Other topics include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
 Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to agree to a five-year period.
 The shooters in the extra pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
 As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting conservation park and heritage manager at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first cull have been duly trained and briefed on safety procedures.
 Martelly inaugurated yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
 This is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.
 This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
 These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
 Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been notified of 27 accidents involving the devices.
 Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “non-critical.”
 The ministry reacted by calling the Apple report's postponement "really regrettable."
 The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
 The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
 In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
 A former Filipino policeman took hostage Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
 Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
 Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
 Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
 He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
 While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
 His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the baby's lung maturation.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
 Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
 Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of a full moon. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
 Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and she'll be missed... I hope she's resting in a better place."
 A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
 Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
 34% of those surveyed share this view, and wish that Queen Elizabeth II was the last monarch to reign over Australia.
 At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints his fitness has been called into question.
 He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as it was banned from the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
 Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets may have been a source of water and organic matter for the Earth, which can form proteins and support life.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
 Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He called the rumors "gossip and political nonsense."
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
 It relies on satellite technology, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
 Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park and ride facilities are not available on the ground.
 Fear of transportation shortages has led to the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
 A study published Thursday in the journal Science detailed the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant conical-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
 It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
 The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
 The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
 Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
 The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flushing system in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
 Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
 The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
 It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
 The wheel changed the world in many ways. The greatest benefit it brought us was to make transportation much simpler and faster.
 This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
 Below are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and other deer.
 In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat many more small prey items, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from entering into competition with others.
 Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The packs are composed of one to three adult males related, as well as about thirty females and cubs.
 Women are generally very close to each other, as their family is composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides act like wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
 A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
 The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, and is the only cat that roars.
 The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather a sentence whose words would be cries and growls.
 Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
 According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find food (prey) by smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
 They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move very stealthily. Ocelots stalk their prey, blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
 When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population it came from (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
 This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
 The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
 Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
 We call this process “speciation,” which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
 Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
 We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
 The mosasaur was the super-predator of the time, it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
 Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
 We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
 He also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for him.
 Although the Romans ate foods we know today, they also ate some strange or unusual dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the shrew, a type of rodent.
 Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they ate.
 Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin, which were introduced to Europe centuries later.
 For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
 The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered as the god's home.
 People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
 Some pyramid towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
 Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
 Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open counters on the street; houses were built of stone.
 As there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and that he found Greenland — and named it so — while travelling further west.
 But regardless of its discovery, Eskimos tribes already lived there at the time.
 Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you saw the movie National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were printed on the back of the document, upside down.
 Although no one knows who actually wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the Great Scroll (which measures about 29 and three-quarters inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
 It is therefore likely that the rating was added simply as a label.
 The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
 It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of fighting it.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon".
 In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
 A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
 The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it refers.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and a fair distribution.
 Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
 During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
 The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
 Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or from customs duties between the states.
 The articles required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is, with the German national team, the second most successful national team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
 Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
 Due to the group of islands that make up the country, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
 The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through there mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island”.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese labourers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
 In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
 In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
 For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue era.
 It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera's photographic sensor.
 The 35mm format is actually, and this is quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
 So the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of whole number ratios) is 3:2.
 Many common formats (the APS family, for example) are equal to this aspect ratio or close to it.
 The third-party rule, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
 It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
 For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
 His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
 The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this doctrine was being followed.
 Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
 This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire stretches of sea, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
 As this tactic only met with a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
 After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
 He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
 Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
 During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
 There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one leader.
 Also, after the Revolution, trades were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
 The same is true for the army, as the ranking of the armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that transcended the mundane affairs of this life. He used to frequent a cave which became famous as “Hira’” on the mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
 The cave itself, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual leanings.
 Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even though we know it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated.
 Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
 Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
 The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
 The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
 The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the nock (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
 An up bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down bow is louder and more assertive.
 Feel free to mark your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and should therefore generally be respected.
 On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors.
 In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the king and queen.
 The King and Queen were obliged, on account of the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
 At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
 The war expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
 Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
 These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – the period of European history from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
 The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself proceeds according to a process that largely transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically rather than socially conditioned societies.
 For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
 However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
 Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of healthcare to treat the resulting injuries.
 Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have appeared, in harmony with the places occupied by society, preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
 In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of the world’s contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
 Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
 Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
 It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
 At first, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
 However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western fashions could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
 During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for clothing fasteners.
 Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system using locally adapted seed stocks combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
 Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
 Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
 The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
 One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
 These children are considered "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability of the child.
 Street children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
 Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
 When they are fully raised by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
 While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
 Support is not a method of learning but rather a way to help learners who are discovering new learning such as using a new program or starting a new project.
 Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is too.
 Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
 Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
 No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing and educational, but that is the case.
 We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
 Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
 The foster care placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
 The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
 The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
 For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 “Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
 The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
 It is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
 Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
 He even suggests that such capacities for interpreting human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
 The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
 Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two pools at each generation.
 In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
 In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
 The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
 In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
 All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savanna chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep interruption is the process of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
 This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can wake up without fully waking up.
 If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other biorythmic-based possibilities include drinking a lot of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
 The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
 The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Every person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
 With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakened consciousness created.
 Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between these two countries.
 Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
 It would last for the next 40 years and see real fighting, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
 On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
 But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
 The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
 The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
 One of the most notable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this traffic.
 Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
 It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
 Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herdsmen who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term shepherd. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
 The "wagonways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
 Although the wagonways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day.
 The cross-ties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top.
 This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
 The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“upright man”).
 Their predecessors, the australopithecines, were not walking upright as usual.
 Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
 We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate future suffering.
 In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
 It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
 After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
 During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
 The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
 One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the earliest copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
 Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
 Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
 But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
 They have clawed feet covered in scales and have claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
 Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon.
 An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
 The best clue to an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household chemicals or medications.
 Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
 The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
 This term derives from an old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects very adapted to parasitize humans.
 Bedbugs, like bedbugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
 In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
 Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
 A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of a baby.
 These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
 However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and in particular the Bible in Latin.
 The opinions of Aristotle on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
 The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
 Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife and flora.
 Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem are examples of activities on site.
 For example, you can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
 Every morning people leave the small country towns in their cars to go to work and they meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
 In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a system of transport based on private cars and supports it.
 Science now shows that this carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
 Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Virtually everyone complains about transport systems.
 In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
 Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
 Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other.
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
 To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
 This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
 Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
 A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the sun.
 Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
 This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
 The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
 No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
 The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
 Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
 Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were awed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
 The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
 The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
 Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
 Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they occur in nature in their raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
 Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order) solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
 There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
 Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
 So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
 Unfortunately, the advent of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more private status and to rarer uses.
 People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
 One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes along.
 The fission bomb works on the principle of transforming energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
 It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. By splitting the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
 Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
 The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
 The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
 It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
 There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or what attracts them.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
 These theories examine what motivates some people to want to do the things they do and what in their environment motivates them to do or not do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues: one is to try to remain the "good guy" (or "good gal").
 This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her own way.
 After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
 Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
 The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
 Why would an organization want to go through the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
 Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
 Before an organization can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
 Angel (2006) presents the Continuum Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
 Neurobiological data provides material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumors and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
 The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
 This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
 Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
 Artificial intelligence research is aimed at the automation of intelligent behavior, i.e. actions that exhibit intelligence.
 Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
 These practices led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
 AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many home computer software and video games.
 Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not feasible.
 The solution is technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view ancient museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
 Participating in a virtual excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
 For example, students at Bennet Elementary School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an archive.
 Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the fact of having an audience usually makes things better.
 As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
 In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to pique the interest of the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
 "When used well, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their own views with those of others and express their own opinions on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
 Further south you will find the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surrounding areas which have a pristine natural beauty.
 All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
 Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in their wild state.
 For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
 The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
 Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
 European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route that connected Europe to India.
 To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 To women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
 It is also advisable to wear a ring (which should not look too valuable.
 Women must realize that some cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment, such as being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Be firm in refusing advances from men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it does not mean it is acceptable!)
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
 The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it after destroying it and renamed it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
 The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
 Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
 Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and all sorts of trinkets, but that's it for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city’s streets, particularly the downtown area.
 Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting that continues in the province of North Kivu.
 The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks of mountain gorilla tracking among the cheapest in Africa.
 You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
 Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
 Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
 In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
 It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates's PBS series "Wonders of the African World."
 The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
 The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, the Zimbabwe border to the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
 The total area of the park is 19,500 km², which is divided into 14 ecozones, each with its own specific fauna.
 It is one of the most famous theme parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
 It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
 The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents the main center of interest for many tourists.
 The row of buildings that draws the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a flashing bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbour.
 The vast majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is concentrated on the north shore landfills.
 It is the place that the British settlers invested in, so it seems to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
 The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
 The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests are not, however, composed solely of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
 The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/marshes.
 Sundarbans is a nature reserve since 1966, you can find there about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, particularly those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
 Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most districts are served by small Japanese ferries, which are comfortable and sturdy.
 Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
 The two towers are 83 meters high; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
 The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
 The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
 The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
 Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly thanks to fishing, hunting, or gathering.
 In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called the "giant province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
 The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
 Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best players in the world.
 The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
 In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes organized here at other times of the year.
 For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
 The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
 On the neighbouring islands, credit cards may not be accepted, even though British and American currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a method of payment.
 It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so change it before leaving.
 Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there, and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures exceeding 30 °C are common.
 Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
 There are no real "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
 Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
 According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
 As docile as they may seem, the bison, elk, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
 Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
 All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
 The supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city, during the Mau movement for independence.
 There are many beaches, as Auckland is on two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
 The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
 These beaches, sometimes very crowded by families, have many shops along the coastline. Swimming is safe.
 The main local beer is Number One, a fairly ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, Manta.
 There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
 You can drink the local tap water without any danger, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns about it.
 For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (not froth) and tea is served without milk.
 Hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
 Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
 Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
 From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away.
 Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
 Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
 Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
 Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine the flight and the accommodation.
 They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents you need for your destination (for example, a visa).
 Any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
 At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it to be an integral part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the music, you'll have to get there early to find a good camping spot.
 Remember that even though the main music stages are finished for the day, other music shows can continue until late into the night at other festival sites.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
 If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
 St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
 Casinos generally make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
 They usually offer special deals on food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and on the premises.
 On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic drinks. Nevertheless, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
 Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
 On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
 During blizzards, it can snow enough in a short time to block you in.
 Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
 On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
 Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable time for many visitors.
 In common parlance, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on the African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the spectacular sight of wild animals in their natural habitat.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be well observed.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
 A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, foot safari or footing) is a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
 The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, after hosting the Games in 1964.
 If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend through July 2020, the date the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
 Tickets for events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
 By ironing wet clothes, you can dry them more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there is none in the room.
 If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
 Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn).
 There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
 In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
 Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
 Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
 Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
 Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered parasites.
 In some locations, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
 Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
 The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, frequently passing through isolated back country terrain.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves are prevalent.
 The posted speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and following sections – generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than before.
 On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
 Fruit pies are common: apples are baked and cooked into pies all year round, while cherries and plums make an appearance in the summer.
 Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berliners, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
 A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
 A curry dish can be either "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
 In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
 With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours favoured by Javanese being peanuts, chillies, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang from either side of the saddle.
 They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: the user's feet can get stuck in them.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
 First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
 Then some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider who falls.
 Cochamó Valley – The premier destination for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many great granite walls and cliffs.
 From the tops of the mountains, the views of the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
 Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
 Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
 The idea of skiing is very old: some cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
 The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
 Cross-country skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
 It resembles alpine touring skiing, as well as mountaineering, without generally incorporating these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
 Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
 In good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than on foot – but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so traveling through several countries usually means applying for several visas and having several passports checked.
 The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a single country in this regard.
 As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
 Likewise, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
 There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as items over 100 years old.
 The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
 Handmade products may be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
 Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
 Although, according to tradition, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
 Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
 Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term “Gypsy” is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a misrepresentation of the Roma people.
 If the country you are travelling to is subject to a travel advisory issued by your government, your travel insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 You can also seek advice from other governments, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
 As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
 The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
 Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
 Very unfavorable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric features.
 Severe winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
 Extreme weather phenomena, regional and seasonal, include cold snaps, snowstorms with high winds, and sand or dust storms.
 It is strongly recommended that travellers research the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, as this may affect the itineraries they are considering.
 Anyone who is considering going to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
 A search on the internet for "Courses in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
 A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
 A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are few.
 Travellers who plan to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
 The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender designation (X) or to update documents to match the name and gender a person prefers varies.
 The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is equally variable.
 Security checkpoint searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
 Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
 Rip currents are currents that return from the waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
 Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current towards the deep water can form there.
 In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
 As soon as you get out of the current, the return to swimming is not more difficult than usual.
 Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It is also possible, depending on your skill and whether or not you have been spotted, that you may want to wait for help.
 The re-entry shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
 Travelers who have had a hard time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a hard time adjusting to their home culture.
 When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your original culture's habits.
 At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adjust.
 People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
 The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
 Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
 The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
 The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.
 The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
 The archipelago is located 120 km north of the mainland and the largest island, King George Island, is home to the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
 Other examples are Livingston and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth mountain range, 360 km long and crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
 The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4,892 m (16,050 ft).
 In remote areas without cell phone coverage, you may have no choice but to use satellite phone service.
 A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, because you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
 It is a service often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
 Your local phone company should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
 Those who plan a gap year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
 This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
 Often, having taken a gap year abroad can actually give you a better chance of getting into higher education in your home country.
 In general, there is a fee to take these educational programs.
 Finland is a popular destination for boating. The “Land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
 You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelago and on the lakes.
 While the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
 Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
 Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
 Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to the boat at night.
 If you only go to land with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
 The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
 Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
 There is no shame in this: it is no different from the fears and anxieties that many people have about other things.
 For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
 Transport companies are well paid to make fast deliveries. Often, in the context of an urgent repair, the question of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
 On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there has been a problem.
 If they had sent the goods by air freight, on some routes it would have taken days to get through the unloading and customs.
 The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send a bag without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
 The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money for that privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
 However, it is not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
 In general, it is pointless to try to get discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of traveller who is willing to pay a high price for the privilege of speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
 In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
 Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
 The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
 With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub.
 What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial centre, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
 The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
 The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
 In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures representing doves on some tombs.
 It is worth walking for half an hour in this fascinating village.
 The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and was made famous to foreigners by the glowing account of its splendor that was written by Lord Byron.
 The bus 403 of Scotturb goes regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
 On your way north, be sure to visit the beautiful sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place worldwide known for the apparitions of Mary.
 Remember that you are visiting essentially a cemetery, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
 There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their relatives murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews and non-Jews alike.
 Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
 Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
 However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law states that it is the first official language.
 However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
 Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
 Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as possible, to act like a good person. This will make your travels considerably easier.
 The abrupt outsides of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 The country has a great variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitudes.
 The region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
 Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be seen here, as well as many other common species.
 When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered.
 Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring your own, and in addition it has bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
 Just as men must wear pants covering the knees.
 You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but as it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A one-size-fits-all for men!
 Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
 A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 All names, followed by the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
 This is a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
 It can also be said to facilitate reading, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
 Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
 The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
 Also make sure to pronounce “r” and “rr” in a distinct way: “caro” means “dear,” while “carro” means “cart.”
 Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
 Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand the sentences.
 It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
 However, those who speak some Spanish may be tempted to conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it need not be studied separately.
 Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or education sites.
 As light pollution at their time was not as preoccupying as today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in the modern era.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote regions where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
 The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
 Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take just "one" home.
 If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "specimens" will also get you kicked out without discussion.
 Singapore is generally considered to be an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything you need once you arrive.
 But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and a strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
 There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
 Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a great theme for a vacation.
 For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
 They also define routes for popular hiking trails and bicycle paths.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
 Many traditions associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
 It is a tradition to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
 There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
 More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the party at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that have arrived on these islands have done so originally by water, either swimming or on floating objects, or by air.
 Due to the great distance that separates them from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
 Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you may experience polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
 This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
 As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
 The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
 The costumes are classic workwear, and employees are addressed by their last name or by their job title.
 Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes the collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
 Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for any decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
