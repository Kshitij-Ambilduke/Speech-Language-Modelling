 While on the one hand there seems to be an experimental vaccine that can reduce mortality from Ebola, on the other hand no drug has yet been found that has clearly proven suitable for the treatment of the existing infection.
 An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising in the field, but formal studies have revealed it to be less effective than hoped in preventing deaths.
 In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three therapies.
 USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee’s letter and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work together to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
 We agree with the USOC that the best interests of our athletes and our clubs, and of their sport, can be best served by pursuing meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.
 USA Gymnastics has commissioned an independent investigation to understand how it is possible that an abuse of the size described with such courage by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar has remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate changes.
 USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and accountable environment.

 This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 . According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-gray on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid color in the lower part.
 The discovery also allows detailed information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Since the dinosaur's plumage is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows a feathering of an adult and not the down of a chick.
 According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

 They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the solar system is determined by nothing more than their brightness and rotation.
 Brightness is used together with rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
 The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

 The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the actual observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The team's goal was to produce the effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
 Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
 This theory states that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

 Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
 According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, because of the high mortality rate".
 According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.
 In the course of a year an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 close contacts.
 Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

 The infrared images show thermal variations between day and night, demonstrating that they are probably caves.
 During the day they are colder than the surrounding surface and at night they are warmer.
 Glen Cushing, a member of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as steady as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground."
 In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed ballot into a sealed envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
 After verifying his or her identity with the officials, the voter deposits the ballot in the ballot box and signs the register.
 The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict way.
 Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that at the beginning of the vote there are no envelopes and that no others are added to those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
 Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

 Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at a fifth man's head. Schneider has constant pain, is blind in one eye, has a section of his skull missing and his face has been rebuilt in titanium.
 Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
 In addition to the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
 The first in slalom, where at the first run he recorded a DNF. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not complete the test.
 The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, she was tenth in the women's category "seated", with a combined time of 4:41.30, more than 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and more than 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
 Four skiers in the women's group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to finish the race.
 The police in Madhya Pradesh managed to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen.
 Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: "Five people have been arrested for raping the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
 The names of the accused are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
 None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash was injured.
 Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
 The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of killing his own son.
 She is held in custody pending trial and sentencing, but any testimony she gives as an eyewitness could be tainted, since her image has been widely publicized.
 This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters: the Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
 According to Pamela Ferguson, professor at the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
 The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until the formal charge was made.
 The document is expected to address the issue of borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 lines.
 Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
 Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such presence only for five years.
 Shooters in the experimental pest control program were closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
 As part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
 Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
 This is the fifth provisional electoral council of Martelly in four years.
 Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
 The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests, which began in October, that have challenged the regime.
 The occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
 About 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
 Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "non-serious".
 In its response, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report "absolutely deplorable."
 The earthquake in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
 According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage was reported in the nation.
 And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
 In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took hostage tourists from Hong Kong after hijacking their bus.
 With his M16 Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists.
 Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
 Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed immediately along with the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
 After training as an obstetrician, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While serving at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor in his spare time.
 His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight recordings.
 Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Alone, just like her. A strong woman."
 "Luna was as weird as me… Maybe even more… I love her and I'm going to miss her… Let's hope she's in a better place," was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
 According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
 During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
 This view is shared by 34% of survey participants, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
 At the other end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become one.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but has suffered a number of injuries that have raised doubts over her fitness.
 He could not take the necessary painkillers to get through the pain because they are banned from the Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri University, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
 The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
 Comets could have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter, the material that can form proteins and support life, to Earth.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
 Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law making same-sex marriage legal.
 According to him, speculation is nothing but "political chatter and nonsense".
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 According to the FAA, NextGen would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
 The system uses satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
 No additional transport is being laid on and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no car parking or interchange facilities on site.
 Fears about the lack of transportation have made it possible to play the match obligatorily behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
 According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
 According to researchers from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time required for this process was much longer; this is due to the mating between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
 It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable for being twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
 This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the cabbage juice is possible to build a pH indicator.
 The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
 The pH level of the chemical analysed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
 Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
 Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
 Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
 In Greece, in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewerage systems have been discovered.
 Toilets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted in public baths, frequented by a mixed public of men and women.
 To call someone far away thousands of miles, a satellite is used.
 The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
 The satellite was launched into space with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision.
 To transport a satellite or telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet tall.
 The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
 Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation came into being.
 Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that feed on small prey, notably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
 Lions are the most social of the felines and live in large groups called prides.
 The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related, and a number of females and cubs that can reach 30.
 Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
 The lion pack behaves in a way very similar to the wolf or dog pack, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
 A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not very well), swim, jump very long and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
 The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
 The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but it is more like a sentence of words shouted and angry.
 Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
 Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
 Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, and they are also able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves in the surrounding environment and then pounce on them.
 When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a return difficult), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
 This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those needed previously.
 The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 As time passes and the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks more and more like the other population.
 At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
 This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (through breathing).
 Plants make their own food with the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade.
 We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
 From its long jaws protruded more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus a further row on the palate, so that for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
 We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's possible that it was a cannibal.
 He would attack anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not have been able to compete with him.
 Although most of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included some strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called a hare.
 Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together lying on their sides while they ate.
 Of course, the ancient Romans did not eat many foods that were introduced to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
 For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
 The Babylonians built a main temple for each god, which was considered the god's home.
 People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
 Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
 Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
 Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
 Women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor stalls that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his voyage after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
 But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
 Although all of them are "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were very different.
 If you've seen the movie "The Da Vinci Code," you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map to a treasure.
 However, this is false. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
 Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
 Probably, therefore, the annotation was only added as a label.
 The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
 It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive operation was called "Operation Dragoon".
 American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
 Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in a cooperative manner, forming a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn linked with "civis", that is citizen, and "civitas", that is city or city-state, and in a certain way defines also the dimensions of society.
 The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge through several generations, to leave a cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
 Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are thus not recognized as true civilizations.
 During the war of independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and the Congress was its only member, according to the Articles of Confederation.
 The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
 He had no authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
 To amend the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which in turn had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track and field, and Formula 1 auto racing.
 Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
 Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
 From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
 Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by soon recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
 The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the aboriginals' cereal production systems and bringing in Chinese laborers to work in its sugar and rice plantations.
 In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
 After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
 Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
 Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
 In 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
 The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
 It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor sizes of digital cameras.
 Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
 The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
 The proportions of many of the common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
 The much-used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
 According to this rule, the most effective place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
 At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
 Christianity had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
 His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
 One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
 The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to ask whether this principle has been respected.
 Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
 The strategy proved effective: it involved the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law, as codified by numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent access to entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
 As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its indiscriminate U-boat warfare campaign.
 In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
 After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
 He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his boss in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
 In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
 Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The most famous was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
 In these periods, between many nobles fighting for the throne, fierce wars broke out.
 The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to gain a place of honour in the vast palace of Xi'an.
 The social and political effects are numerous, among these can be cited the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
 In addition, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
 The same goes for the military, since the army’s rankings are now based on caliber instead of class.
 The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
 The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad.
 The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
 In reality it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
 There is nothing but a beautiful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
 Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day.
 Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the Great Sphinx.
 The important pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
 The "upward arc" sign looks like a V and the "downward arc" sign looks like a staple or a square with a missing bottom.
 Upwards means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
 An up bow usually generates a softer sound, while with a down bow it results in a stronger and more decisive sound.
 You can decide to add your personalized indications with a pencil, but keep in mind that the archeggio signs you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
 On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with his wife Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
 They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the sovereigns.
 The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
 At some point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
 The war expenses of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
 Clearly the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, we must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
 The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
 The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends conventionally in about 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that is very much beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has in turn "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
 For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
 However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
 The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new techniques of first aid for the treatment of injured people.
 Romanticism was characterized by a strong cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs and culture have arisen linked to this geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
 Like Paris, now known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
 Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
 During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly because the crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
 It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
 The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
 Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
 But the slowness of communication routes means that the diffusion of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
 Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually organic, using locally adapted seeds and crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yields.
 Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it still is.
 Subcultures unite individuals with similar opinions who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, position and/or gender of its members.
 The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and slang.
 One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, following misfortunes, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
 These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
 Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
 Other children may have been raised by animals; others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
 When a feral child is raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors (within the physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
 Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
 Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little paper clip-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
 The virtual scaffolds are integrated in the software and have the purpose of interrogating, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty in managing alone.
 Children are given up for adoption for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, not to mention extortion.
 A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nutrition, care and education, but they do.
 We believe that fostering is a safe place for these children.
 Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
 It is assumed that the foster care will meet all the needs not met in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
 The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
 For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet are suggested "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
 Eighmey and McCord (1998) study of the public's reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
 The use of video recording has allowed to reach significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
 In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks has illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
 He even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
 In the 20th century, research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
 With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
 Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
 For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available in the savannah.
 In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
 The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless cooked.
 Animal foods (such as ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
 In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
 Sleep disruption is the intentional process of waking during the normal sleep period, followed by a return to sleep (10–60 minutes later).
 This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
 If you decide to reset the clock in the sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options focused on the biorhythm include the consumption of many fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up to urinate.
 A person enjoys inner peace in proportion to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
 The less tension, the more positive the life force. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
 Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra and visualizations.
 Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to the collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts led to the break between the two countries.
 Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; the Cold War had begun.
 It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
 On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans proved to be obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
 Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
 The task of the Navy has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
 One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most worthy of note is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
 At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
 If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
 It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 They were first bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity for their milk, wool, meat and hides.
 Domestic goats were usually raised in herds allowed to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by kids (similar to shepherds) who were often children or teenagers. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
 In the 16th century, wagonways were already being built in England.
 Although they were simply made of parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, compared to the slightly more bumpy roads of the period, allowed the horses that travelled on them to reach higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
 The sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a top iron bar.
 It became a common practice, even if the iron caused a greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
 The first means of transportation that mankind has known are the legs. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
 His predecessor, the australopithecine, did not habitually walk upright.
 Signs of bipedal locomotion are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus was bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
 To try to mitigate in some measure the future sufferings we can start to adopt lifestyles more respectful of the environment, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
 In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If we want a permanent solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
 It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
 After the Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were produced that night, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
 The document was first read aloud on July 8 in Independence Hall's courtyard and the task was given to John Nixon.
 One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, while a copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known copies of the document, the original having been lost.
 According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
 Many tend to not consider them dinosaurs because of the feathers and their ability to fly.
 Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them to dinosaurs.
 Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
 Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently in use.
 A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
 Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
 The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
 Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
 The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
 The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
 Both the assassin bugs and the bed bugs are nesting, that is, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
 In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 The research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double those of males.
 A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in that of their child.
 These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
 In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific inquiry.
 But it is not only about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to orient the scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
 The opinions of Aristotle on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
 Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior are determined by the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to periodic external signals, in relation to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
 One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
 Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells affected belong to the germ line.
 The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the level of the germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
 Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
 Examples of activities to do on the spot include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
 For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
 Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place from which they have just left.
 In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a system of transport based on private cars, which in turn support.
 Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
 Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
 In developed countries, it is rare to hear such levels of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
 Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
 Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
 Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
 Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a generic way.
 To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
 Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects are benefited by the ability to fold their wings along their bodies.
 This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
 Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
 Some were right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and the other stars), moved around the Earth.
 Which seems sensible, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
 The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river in the world. It carries 8 times the amount of water that the second largest river carries.
 The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
 The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
 Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
 The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
 The official language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
 Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
 In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
 Humans have been aware of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
 According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
 These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances, forming what we see.
 Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
 There may also be alloys composed of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
 In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are incredibly tiny, so many trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 After its invention, the pencil has proved to be a good friend to many.
 Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to a less and less widespread use.
 Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a thermometer.
 We can only wonder what fate will befall the keyboard when something newer arrives.
 The principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is at the heart of the operation of the fission bomb.
 It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the nucleus further, some of that energy is released.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, this means that they tend to break up in the presence of a small or no push.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
 The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
 It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
 The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
 Content theories focus on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
 According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
 These theories analyze what is common to some people and pushes them to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
 Among the most popular theories about the content of the job are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there is the one who tries to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
 The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
 At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he must change the whole team's work and make it his own.
 Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 This attitude often creates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
 The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
 Members of the virtual team often have the function of contact point for their next physical group.
 They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as matches can take place according to various time zones, which may not be covered by the local management.
 The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member refers and is the one that establishes the standards for each member.
 Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? A good reason for implementing the concepts of organizational learning may be innovation.
 When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
 Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
 For an organization to be innovative, leaders must create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) illustrates the theory of the continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
 Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and thus much more precise.
 The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of the scientists' research.
 It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
 The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been observed before.
 This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
 Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
 AI research includes the creation of machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
 These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
 AI is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is integrated into many software applications for home computers and video games.
 Field trips are an important part of the curriculum. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
 The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see the artifacts of museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
 Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
 For example, every year the students of Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
 Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Often, their first experiences with blogging are marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
 Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving his writing.
 Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment they are in" and the need to engage the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
 The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning beyond the normal school day.
 The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as delineate their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is the bilingual and charming capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
 Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
 All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
 The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 If you compare the population, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-Americans is higher than the number of Canadian citizens.
 The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
 Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
 In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
 In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, which goes from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
 To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
 For female travellers: all women are advised to declare themselves married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
 Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
 Have the courage to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategic port used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinides.
 The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
 The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city, which was called Daru l-Badya, and then renamed Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose this place for their trading bases.
 Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
 In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of bric-a-brac, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city located in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
 In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
 While Goma is reasonably safe, it is wise to research thoroughly before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
 The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
 It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
 Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
 Today, Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
 In 1990 it was included in the list of Unesco World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
 In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stops.
 With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
 The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, in the north it borders with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
 With a surface area of 19,500 km², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
 It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
 As with all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee.
 A Wild Card is also a good option, as it gives you access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
 The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
 The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, made even more striking by its setting on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
 To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbour.
 Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated north shore.
 This is the place the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
 The Sundarbans are the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
 The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
 However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the once-immense jungles that covered the Ganges plain.
 The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one third is made up of swampy areas.
 Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; in the area it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
 Since buses between districts are often full, it is best to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most of the neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
 Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
 Its two pylons are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
 Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
 By September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
 The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practised subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
 Paraguay, formerly called "The great province of the Indies", was born in the sixteenth century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
 The Spanish started a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
 Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its native peculiarities.
 Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and players in the world.
 In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the Las Cañitas polo fields.
 Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches even at other times of the year.
 For information on tournaments and tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
 The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound sterling (GBP).
 The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop, offers currency exchange services.
 British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
 It is likely that the outer islands will not accept credit cards, although British and US currency may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
 It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
 Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
 Montevideo is situated in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
 Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the impression of a lower temperature than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
 Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
 Park officials recommend keeping at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
 No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a safe distance. It is necessary to leave these animals a proper space, as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
 Also, keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors, and keep your camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 In this port there was the infamous naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
 All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
 During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
 There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbours, and the most popular ones are divided into three areas.
 The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
 These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
 These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide range of shops and safe for swimming.
 The most famous local beer is a simple, refreshing and pleasant beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
 You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better face the journey.
 The tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
 According to the Australians, the flat white coffee is born from a foreign idea. The espresso is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
 Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
 Throughout the year, many excursions are made to the coral reef and injuries for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
 Always ask for advice from the authorities, follow the instructions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
 Cubomedusae appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy, and outside this period are only occasionally found.
 Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to keep their distance.
 The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living actively in the ocean.
 By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they have arrived at their destination.
 Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
 Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
 They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get further documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
 However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
 At some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
 To be close to the action, you need to arrive early and claim a space near the music.
 Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music goes on until late at night.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing causes quite a bit of noise for those who are more exposed to it.
 St. Petersburg cruises include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa-free entry (check conditions).
 Casinos generally do everything they can to increase the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
 They usually offer food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and to keep them around.
 In some venues, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to remain sober.
 Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
 On icy and snowy roads, the friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
 During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
 Even precipitation and snow flurries, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can reduce visibility.
 However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
 Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of many visitors' holidays.
 In its popular usage, the term safari refers to overland trips, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come closer to cars, so a normal camera equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be observed better with binoculars.
 A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "safari escursionistico", or "safari on foot") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
 The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having previously hosted the 1964 Games.
 If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not extend past July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
 The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
 Ironing wet clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
 If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
 Be careful not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
 There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
 In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
 The effectiveness of filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
 Travellers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not found in their home regions.
 Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
 The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
 Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free and duty-free products in certain locations.
 Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
 The Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as there are steep slopes, narrow roads and tight bends.
 The speed limits shown are much lower than those on the previous and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Strict compliance with them is extremely important.
 Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria to the south.
 Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from the apple cakes available all year round to cherry and plum cakes, which make their appearance during the summer.
 Several German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
 Those who want to taste small but tasty cakes can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
 Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices mixed with meat or vegetables.
 Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
 In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the interior regions is normally used yogurt; in southern India and in some other coastal regions of the subcontinent is more used coconut milk.
 With 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
 However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
 The cuisine of Java, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are attached to the sides of the saddle.
 They provide greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped.
 If a jockey is thrown off a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged along by the horse as it runs away. To minimise this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
 First, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
 Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have included safety bars, which make a leather strap detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
 Cochamó Valley: the most important destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs are worked.
 The peaks of the summits include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are continually tracing new routes on its walls, potentially infinite.
 Snow sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are very popular and involve sliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
 Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes even called "ski bums", who dedicate entire periods of vacation to the skiing in a particular area.
 The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
 Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
 Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
 It is related, although it does not usually include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
 Think of the ski run as a hiking trail.
 If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on groomed trails.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through several countries you would need to apply for a visa and passport control several times.
 However, in this respect, the Schengen area works more like a single country.
 If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
 Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for individual visas for each member state, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
 There is no universal definition of what makes an item an antique. Some tax agencies consider an item to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
 The definition presents geographical differences in age limits that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
 Crafts objects could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
 Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
 Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as work animals.
 Today, many Sámi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
 Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
 If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you are visiting, there could be consequences for your travel insurance or your cancellation insurance.
 You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 The alerts simply constitute a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
 The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
 "Adverse weather conditions" is the general expression used to describe any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
 Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, above-average rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea-hurricanes and cyclones.
 Among the phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sand storms.
 Travellers are advised to check the weather conditions in their area, as they may affect their travel plans.
 Anyone planning to visit a country that is potentially considered a war zone should have professional training.
 Searching the Internet for 'Survival Course' is likely to find the address of a local company.
 A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
 A course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wild are abundant, while there are few publications about war zones.
 Travellers planning to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct travel documents for their return journey.
 The intention of governments to issue passports without indication of sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
 Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
 Even the security checks have become much more thorough in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
 Transgender people in the pre-operative stage should not expect to pass through the controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
 Rip currents are formed by the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
 Given the submarine topography, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
 Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in the attempt to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
 Once you are out of the current, swimming back will not be as difficult as normal.
 Try to find an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider waiting for help, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
 The reentry shock is manifested in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being there a "honeymoon" phase more reduced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
 Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their home country.
 When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home country.
 In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
 Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were also necessary for those who return home.
 The pyramid's light and sound show is the most interesting thing for children in the area.
 Before the show begins, you can admire the pyramids in the darkness and silence.
 Normally you can always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
 The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
 The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
 Claimed by various countries, the Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
 The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The island King George is the largest and is the seat of the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
 Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water from the origin of a magnificent natural harbor.
 Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and faces the Bellingshausen Sea.
 Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, to then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a chain of 360 km cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
 In remote areas, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
 A satellite phone is not a substitute for a cell phone, because you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
 The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as by missions that require data and voice at a distance.
 Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
 One of the most popular options among those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
 It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
 In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education in the home country.
 Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
 Finland is a great destination for boating. In the "Land of a thousand lakes" there are thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
 You don’t necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
 While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
 Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
 This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally a rather singular fact (for example in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
 Most of the different Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
 No separate visa will be required for land excursions (as of 2009).
 Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Flying can be scary for people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
 There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people have towards other things.
 For some people, understanding a little bit about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
 Drivers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
 For some routes, the larger companies used their own aircraft, but for other routes and for smaller companies, problems emerged.
 On some routes, air shipments would have taken days to clear customs and unload.
 The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger.
 To fly first or business class the obvious way is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
 However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for First Class travel!
 In general, on flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
 Airlines know that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain fares.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of an ethnic conflict in the past.
 In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
 Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
 The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport hub.
 The ancient city of Izmir is built on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is now a modern, developed and active trade center.
 Although the city has a Mediterranean atmosphere, wide avenues, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with the characteristic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches.
 In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
 In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
 A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
 To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
 The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
 Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
 Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has a meaning almost incalculable for a significant part of the world's population.
 There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
 Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
 Avoid defacing these places by scribbling on the structures with marks or graffiti.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, and the vast majority is able to understand it. Spanish is known by virtually everyone.
 However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the official first language by law.
 Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
 On the metro, regular announcements are only in Catalan, but any unscheduled service interruptions are announced in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
 Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Although often it is only a stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris is to behave as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person, which will facilitate your movements.
 The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic good manners.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, fir and spruce, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
 The area also hosts a great variety of animal and bird species.
 Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie live in these places, along with several other animal species that are more widespread.
 When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
 Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it is brightly colored, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
 Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to their knees.
 These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, one size fits all!
 The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
 Pa amb Oli is a simple popular summer dish: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form of "you", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
 This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
 This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes the writing rather complex.
 Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
 The main letters to pay attention to are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
 Also make sure you pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
 Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
 Therefore, reading this basic grammar book could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding of sentences.
 It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
 However, people with a basic knowledge of Spanish may come to the precipitous conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not have to be studied separately.
 Nowadays, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
 Since light pollution in their heyday was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations where the atmospheric conditions are favourable.
 The admiration of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 The concept was originally from China, where the flowering of the plum trees was preferred.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
 Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even just one.
 If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up a few specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
 In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
 But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
 Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
 Make sure the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
 For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities on the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
 They also define the paths of hiking trails and bicycle paths that are very well known.
 Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
 Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-religious people in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
 A tradition involves spending the Easter night awake in an open place to be able to admire the dawn.
 There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
 In more traditional churches, a Paschal Vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
 Because the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals could not make the journey, and this meant that the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
 Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you can experience polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
 This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
 Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can enjoy the stars.
 In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
 Office wear is normally a jacket and tie or a suit and you address colleagues by their surname or professional title.
 The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than to individual achievements.
 Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
