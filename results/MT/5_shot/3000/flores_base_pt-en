 Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 Federal elections, the percentage of those who are opposed to the change in Australia to become a Republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
 The Prime Minister-In-Waiting, Julia Gillard,
 Thirty four percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II is the last monarch of Australia.
 At the other end of the scale, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a Republic.
 The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
 He was unable to take the medicines he needed to overcome the pain, as these are banned in the games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known as of January twenty five.
 Several people have verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
 It's possible that comets were a source of water to the earth, along with the organic matter that could develop proteins and make life possible.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed, since comets have been hitting the earth for a long time.
 Cuomo, 53, began his term in office earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He referred to the rumors as being, quote, politicism and bullshit.
 It is speculated that he will run for President in 2016.
 The NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly in shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
 It uses satellite-based technology in opposition to the older, more traditional, ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
 There will be no extra transportation and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley.
 The problem of the lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
 On Thursday, the magazine, science, published a study where it reports the discovery of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, in Ecuador.
 Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden,
 The gold can be worked in any kind of shape, it can even be rolled up in small formats.
 It can be stretched to form a thin thread, and can be twisted and braided, and can be hammered or wound into sheets.
 It can be very thin and glued to another metal, and because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
 This is called a PH chemical . You can make a marker using beetroot juice.
 The beet juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
 The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions, or H in pH,
 The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed.
 Mix the two powders and, with your hands clean, mold them into the shape of a ball.
 The moisture on the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of a shell.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a sewer system with a sewage system connected to almost every house.
 Parts of the Minoan sewage systems were found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
 There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantly.
 The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and the scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
 It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
 The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways . The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster way to travel.
 We gave you the train, the car, and several other forms of transportation.
 Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Lastly, there are many small cats, including stray cats, which eat small animals, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The revelation for their success is the concept of a niche, a special function that each cat does that keeps them from competing with each other.
 Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The bands consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to thirty females and young.
 Women are intimately related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lions act in a similar way to groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behaviour,
 A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb, although not well, swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
 The tiger is in the same group as the lion, leopard and the jaguar,
 The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of words gritted and snarled.
 Jaguars like to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
 Scientists believe that the jaguar tracks and finds its prey by smelling where it has been on the ground.
 They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and they can also move in a furtive way.
 When a small group of living things, a small population, is separated from the main population from which it came,
 This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
 The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
 As time goes on, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment,
 Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not be called the same species.
 We call this process of forming new species, speciation, and speciation is a simple and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
 Plants use the sun as their food by means of Photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
 We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we make our food from plants.
 The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
 Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
 We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
 He also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex.
 Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the arganaz.
 Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have their meals together, lying on their sides while they ate.
 Food in ancient Rome did not include foods originating from America and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
 For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a peanut.
 The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the home of their respective deity.
 The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary in which only the priests were allowed to enter.
 Sometimes, special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
 The majority of the Jewish life happened outdoors.
 The women cooked in the yard, the shops were only open fronts to the street, and stones were used in the construction of the houses.
 There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated in the early days, and the Norse Sagas say that Erik the Red,
 But, regardless of his discovery, Eskimos had been living there at the time.
 Although all the countries were Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, Kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you've seen the movie National treasure, you might think that a map to the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 But it's not true . Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
 Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words, Declaration of Independence, original, dated July fourth,
 Though no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the great parchment document, which measures twenty-nine and a half inches by twenty-four and a half inches,
 And so it's possible that a note was simply added as a label.
 The landings and the following battles on D-Day liberated the North of France, but the South was still not free.
 It was governed by the French, the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
 On August fourteen, nineteen forty, the Allies invaded Southern France,
 In just two weeks, American and French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning their attention to Germany.
 A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen,
 The city-states are the precursors of the nations. The culture of civilization depends on the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next,
 Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
 During the Revolutionary war, the thirteen States first formed a weak central government,
 The Congress lacked power to demand taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary,
 And there was no authority to repeal the laws of taxation and tariffs between the States.
 The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the States gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
 The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world, and won the FIFA world cup in two thousand and six.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, Rugby, Cycling, ice hockey, and F1 racing.
 Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
 Japan has around 7,000 Islands, with Honshu being the largest, making it the 7th largest Island in the world.
 Due to the cluster of Islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an Arquipelago.
 The foundation of Taiwan goes back to the fifteenth century, when Europeans who were sailing through the region,
 In 1624, the Dutch East India company opened a base in the Southwest of Taiwan, transforming the way aboriginal peoples grew crops and employed Chinese people to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty,
 In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war,
 Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally.
 In the year nineteen seventy six, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
 As an example, the most common still photography format on the planet is the 35 mm, which was the most common film size in circulation at the end of the analog era.
 It is still produced, but the most important is that its proportion was inherited by the formats of Digital camera sensors.
 The 35mm format is, in fact, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
 The proportion of the screen in this format is therefore 3:2.
 Many common formats, like the APS family of formats, for example,
 The much-abused and frequently despised law of thirds is a simple rule that provides a dynamic while at the same time maintaining a relative order in a figure.
 According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, vertical and horizontal,
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful,
 For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European States, despite differences in language and customs.
 All were affected by his forceful influence, from the King to the commoner.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
 The leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether that principle was being upheld.
 Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
 The strategy proved effective, with the cutting of vital supplies to both military and civilian personnel, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law and was provided for in a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, even to neutral ships.
 Germany, once there was a limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestricted U-Boat war.
 During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
 After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the first World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison company in the city of New York.
 He arrived in the United States without a cent, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor,
 China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras, each stage of China or each family that was in power was a different dynasty.
 And between each dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided provinces,
 During these periods, a fierce war raged between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
 The three kingdoms era was one of the most bloody eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great Palace in Xi'An.
 There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to Republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
 And after the revolution, openings were made available to all candidates of the male sex,
 The same is true of the military, since instead of the patents being based on social class,
 The French Revolution also inspired many other people in the working class of other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he used to frequent a cave known as Hira' on the mountain of Noor,
 The very cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
 Sitting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 In fact, it's not easy to find it even if you know it's there, because it's so isolated.
 You can see nothing but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around.
 The great pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
 Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the great pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
 The plateau of Giza, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids,
 The great pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
 The mark of the arrow pointing upward has its appearance similar to a V, and the mark of the arrow pointing downward has its appearance similar to a gram or a square without the bottom side.
 Cima means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and Baixo means you should start at the nock and pull the bow.

 At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead guard in front of the queen, who was terrified.
 The war expenses of the United States in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U S . colonial government to pay for a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds that were floating in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
 Of course, the super profits arising from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of North American imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
 The period in which such events occurred is commonly called the high Middle Ages,
 The high Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which, by convention, end around the year 1500.
 Determinism is a term that encompasses a number of ideas in practice, from the offer of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that the human destiny is determined by a underlying logic associated with the laws of science and the manifestation of those laws in technology.
 The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas the first is that the development of technology follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence,
 For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of highways.
 But a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
 The possession of cars in mass leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health care system to cure the injured.
 The romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 The geography, in the context of Romanticism, made the citizens molded and, with the passing of time, the customs and culture that were in harmony with the place of the society,
 In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world,
 His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
 Its status declined during the twelfth century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders who had returned brought back such things as silks and spices,
 It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashionable city from Constantinople to Paris took place.
 The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
 At first, the clothing was very much influenced by the Byzantine culture in the Eastern region.
 However, due to slow communication channels, the styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
 By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style . One of the biggest advances of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades,
 The agriculture of subsistence is the agriculture that is carried out for the production of food sufficient to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
 The agriculture of subsistence is a simple system, usually organic, that uses seed saved from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
 Historically, the majority of farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
 Subcultures bring together individuals of similar mentalities who feel neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures may be distinctive due to age, Ethnicity, class, location, and or sex of the members.
 The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political,
 Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and jargon.
 One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse,
 These children are called feral or wild. Some of these children were confined by people, usually by their own parents,
 Children who are revolted may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
 It is supposed that others were created by animals, and some are said to have lived in the jungle by themselves.
 When completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits almost entirely similar behavioral patterns to that of the particular pet,
 Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
 The scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
 Scaffolds can be virtual or in person, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold,
 The virtual andaimes are internalized in the software with the objective of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
 Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
 No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for, and educate them, but that's what happens.
 We see the family reception system as a zone of safety for these children.
 Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
 It is assumed that the foster care will meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
 The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
 For example, learning and socialization are indicated as important motives for using the Internet.
 And the other thing is that people are more likely to engage with a Website if they have a personal connection to it.
 The use of Video-Taping led to important discoveries in the interpretation of Micro-Expressions,
 Particularly, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
 Oliver Sacks, in his article, the President's Speech, indicated that people who are incapable of understanding speech because of brain damage are, despite this, able to assess sincerity with precision.
 He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
 Research from the twentieth century concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation,
 The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
 The segregation and the recombination mix up the variation between the two bases with each generation.
 In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources,
 In addition, not acting can have serious consequences, including severe depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The most common vegetable proteins are those found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us, as primates, to Digest unless they are cooked.
 But the foods of animal origin, such as ants, termites, and eggs, are not only easily digested,
 Taking all this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors had solved their own protein problems more or less as the savanna chimpanzees do.
 The interruption of sleep is a process that consists of waking up intentionally during the normal period of sleep and then falling asleep again immediately afterwards.
 This can be easily done by using a half-quiet alarm clock to bring it to consciousness without waking him up.
 If you find yourself redefining the clock while you're asleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid, especially water or tea, a known diuretic,
 The level of inner peace of a person is inversely correlated to their level of physical and spiritual tension.
 The smaller the tension, the greater the positive force that is present in every person.
 Everybody can achieve enlightenment . The only thing that prevents it is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
 With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, Mantras, and visualizations.
 The central part of Tibetan meditation is the visualization of various deities,
 Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
 Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the cold war began.
 The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be leadership of replacement troops from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
 On September 17, the Polish defense was destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army created the Bielorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the Eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact,
 The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
 The work of the Navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
 One of the most notable examples of this was the battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War,
 At the same time, the organization of the German Navy, using mostly U-Boats,
 If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have had the ability to conquer Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
 It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
 The cultures and tribes of old began to keep them in order to facilitate the access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
 The goats were usually kept in herds that wandered in the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by children or teenagers,
 Wagonways were built in England from the sixteenth century onwards.
 Although the wagons consisted only of parallel boards of wood, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on the roads a little more accidental.
 Dormentes were implemented early on, to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
 This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
 Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
 The first means of transportation known was walking, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus,
 His predecessor, the Australopithecus,
 The adaptations for bipedalism are found in the Australopithecus that date between four and three point nine million years ago.
 We can start to live in a way that is more friendly to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
 This is exactly the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we do not wish to have only a temporary solution,
 It is obvious enough that the world has changed very much because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
 After the adoption by the Congress on July fourth, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson,
 During the night, between one hundred and fifty and two hundred copies were made,
 The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the courtyard of the Independence hall on the 8th of July.
 On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap copies that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document,
 Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
 Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
 They have scales on their feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-rex.
 Almost all of the computers that are in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of Binary numbers.
 A Binary number can have only one of two values, that is, zero or one, and these numbers are classified as Binary digits, or bits, using the language used in computing.
 The inner poisoning may not be apparent at once, the symptoms, like vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made at once.
 The greatest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or household chemicals.
 Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
 The term Insecta is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
 The term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very structured insects that stick to human beings.
 Both bees and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nests or shelters of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, there are around 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults.
 The EM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
 The research showed that women have twice as much chance of having multiple sclerosis as men.
 A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
 Such couples are allowed to decide on a plan to adopt the baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents rescind their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
 The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides scientific research.
 It's not, in fact, just experimentation . An experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions,
 Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, and in particular, the Bible in Latin.
 All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including his psychology.
 As the knowledge of Greek recurred, the West found itself increasingly distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Several rhythms observed in physiology and in behavior depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through endogenous clocks.
 The periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to periodic external stimuli, have been found in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
 The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interference of the environment.
 The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase use Phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in the bacteria.
 They did two experiments that marked or the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of Mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material that is affected,
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
 The natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including fauna and flora.
 Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem.
 An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, by car, people leave the small towns of the interior, to go to work in other cities, and they run into other people who work just in those small towns from which they left.
 In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected in some way and supporting a system of transportation based on private cars.
 Today, science points out that this carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
 Everyone participates in the society and uses the transportation systems.
 In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
 Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? are the transport engineers simply incompetent? or is something more fundamental going on?
 Flow of traffic is the analysis of the movement of drivers and of individual vehicles between two different points and of the interactions that they make with each other.
 Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range, so traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
 To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main characteristics:
 These relationships help in planning, designing, and operations of the roadway.
 Insects were the first animals to go into the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
 This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.

 The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to build up a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
 It's more or less like walking up a hill with a heavy cart, the division of the nucleus again liberates some of that energy.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split apart with little or no incentive.
 The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust . The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
 The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
 The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
 There may be more Maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on finding out what motivates people or what attracts them.

 In general, two types of conduct may emerge as managers begin to lead their former co-workers.
 This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, adopting disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an impossible individual who feels that they must change everything that the team has done and do it their own way.
 And the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a team.
 This behavior ends up in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 The virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as the conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
