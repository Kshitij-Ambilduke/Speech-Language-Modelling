 In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping channel.
 Ring has also settled a lawsuit with the competing security firm ADT Corporation.
 While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, there are no medications that have been proven to be clearly suitable for treating existing infections.
 An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising, but formal studies showed that it was less effective at preventing deaths than hoped.

 This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 Scientists say that the feathers of this bird were brown on the top and bright or carotene-colored on the bottom.
 The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do possess other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers speculated that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
 The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not downy feathers.
 A car bomb detonated this morning at the police headquarters of the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty people.
 According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
 Police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
 They have found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
 To determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are combined.
 The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

 The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
 Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
 This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

 Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
 "In an interview, he said the new variant was 'extremely worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate.'"
 Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll said, and at least two were medical hospital staff.

 In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
 After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
 French election law lays down the procedure quite strictly.
 Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the properly counted and authorized voters.
 The candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process, and the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and special procedures.

 The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
 Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her mobile phone and laptop."
 The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
 Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them was injured.
 The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya was meanwhile charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
 She is in custody until trial and sentencing, but witness statements could be tainted because her image has been widely published.
 This is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
 The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made until the trial.
 According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
 Other topics that are allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants such a presence only for five years.
 The hunters of the accompanying experiment to control the plague should be closely supervised by horsemen, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
 As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
 According to Mick O’Flynn, the executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
 Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members.
 It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
 The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
 The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
 Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving the devices.
 "Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious'."
 The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really regrettable."
 The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
 The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security said there were no reports of damage in the territory.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
 A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
 Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
 Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
 Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers took the place of an older lady when she went to the toilet, and Mendoza was shot.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
 He trained as a midwife and took up his work in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm labor in his spare time.
 His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday retrieved two "black box" flight recorders.
 Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
 "Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
 Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
 Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
 The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the election campaign for the Federal election in 2010 that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34 percent of those surveyed agree with this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events, but his fitness was in doubt because of his many complaints.
 He was not able to take the required medication to overcome his pain as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
 Numerous individuals confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
 Since comets collided with the Earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, form.
 Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
 It is speculated that he could run for the office of President in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
 It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
 No additional transport is being provided and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no car parks or park and ride facilities available on site.
 With the concern about lack of transportation, the likelihood of the game being played behind closed doors without the fans of the team grew.
 A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, whereas it was previously thought that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
 It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
 The cabbage juice changes its color, depending on how sour or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
 The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
 Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
 Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women visited in mixed company.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then almost immediately reflects it back down to earth.
 The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view a little.
 It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
 The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service that the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transport.
 It has brought us the railroad, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
 Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small cats (including feral house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
 Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
 The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
 Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) and are just as deadly to their prey.
 As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump great distances and pull with the force of five times a strong man.
 The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
 The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of grumbling roared words.
 Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
 Scientists think that ocelots track and hunt their prey with their sense of smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
 They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
 If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it migrates to a new island so that it cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
 This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
 The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, two populations may look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
 This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
 Plants produce their food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
 We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
 Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set in the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
 We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
 He also grabbed everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was not able to withstand him.
 While we may be familiar with most of their food, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a seven-toed hare.
 Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold joint banquets, where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
 Courts of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
 They had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
 The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
 They brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
 Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such great significance.
 The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
 The women cooked in the yard. Shops consisted simply of shop fronts open to the street. Stone was used for house building.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that when he continued westwards he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
 But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
 Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
 If you have seen the movie "The Mummy Returns", you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 This is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the paper, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words “Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.” The text is written upside down on the bottom of the document.
 While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
 It is therefore possible that the remark was simply added as a label.
 The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
 "It was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them."
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
 After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
 A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper distribution.
 Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
 During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress.
 The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state governments to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
 He also had no power to suspend tax laws and tariffs between the states.
 The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champion.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
 Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
 "Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan, is geographically often referred to as an ""archipelago""."
 The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a change in the rice farming methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked originally.
 By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the most widely used image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
 It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
 In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
 The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
 Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
 The much-maligned and often derided Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamic and at the same time a measure of order in a picture.
 It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally into thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
 In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
 For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European nations together despite different languages and customs.
 His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
 One of the important Christian beliefs states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that it is for this reason that the Church has money.
 The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
 Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
 The strategy proved effective in cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from advancing into whole sea areas, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
 Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
 After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
 He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Each period of time in China and each family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
 Between the individual dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces, the best known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
 In these times, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the fight for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
 There are a lot of social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
 After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
 The same goes for the military, because instead of being based on class, the army ranks were now based on caliber.
 The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light), to meditate.
 The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
 The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
 You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
 The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
 Built in the third century B.C. by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
 The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
 The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
 The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "spread" symbol like a bracket or a square, in which the lower line is missing.
 Up means that you start at the top and push the bow. Down means that you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
 Stroking usually generates a softer sound, while scraping is stronger and more expressive.
 You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed fret markings are there for a reason, and should normally be respected.
 The panicked King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
 They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
 The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
 At some point, a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
 The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
 Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
 The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
 The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad spectrum of ideas in practice, from technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology itself has “effects” on societies that are more inherent than socially caused.
 One could argue that the automobile is indispensable for the development of roads.
 However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
 The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare industry to repair damaged bodies.
 Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
 In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged in relation to this geography and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
 As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so did Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
 Its status declined during the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
 At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
 At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
 However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
 Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological form of agriculture that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
 In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished from other subcultures in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
 The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
 Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
 One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
 "Such children are called ""wild"" or feral. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations."
 Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
 Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild.
 If it was raised completely by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of his specific caretaker, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
 While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little Office Clip Art man.
 Virtual help is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone might not be able to master.
 Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
 No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
 For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children.
 Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
 The foster home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
 The specificities of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach.
 For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 "Personal commitment" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to Web sites.
 The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
 In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to brain damage can still correctly judge the honesty of others.
 He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
 Mutation provides new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
 Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
 Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to cover its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
 In addition, there are serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
 The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
 In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
 Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
 Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
 This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to alert you without fully waking you up.
 If you are someone who sets the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
 The degree of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
 The less tension, the more positive the life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
 With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The center of Tibetan meditation is the God-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture led to the fact that the countries became enemies.
 Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
 It was to last the next 40 years and in reality would be fought out on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places by proxy armies.
 On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and regrouping along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
 The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods over the oceans.
 The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that a nation is able to project and sustain forces and maintain the ability to defeat enemy forces.
 One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
 If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it conquered the rest of Europe.
 Goats were apparently already domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock, in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin.
 House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other pasture lands.  They were tended by goatherds, much like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. This grazing method is still used today.
 As early as the 16th century, in England, people built conveyor belts.
 Although the tram tracks were only made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
 Very early, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it became clear that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient.
 This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
 The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means “upright man”).
 Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright so regularly.
 Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
 We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
 This is in many cases just like a symptomatic treatment. If you want to find and treat the root of the problem, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
 It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of human beings and the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of the people have become more serious.
 After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
 Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
 The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8.
 One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that remain are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript did not survive the ages.
 Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
 Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
 They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
 Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
 An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, for example, vomiting, are so general that one can not immediately make a diagnosis.
 The best sign of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
 Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
 The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
 This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
 Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
 A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
 These couples can choose to adopt a plan for their baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt.
 The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
 It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
 Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
 Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
 Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
 Cyclical behavior patterns, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can run free cycles for a while even in the absence of external signals.
 The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They took two experiments, in which they either labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
 Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
 Examples of activities on the ground are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
 An example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is at the place they have just left.
 In this dynamic commuting, everyone is in some way connected to and supporting a transport system based on the private car.
 Science now points to this massive carbon economy as having pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
 Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
 In developed countries, you will rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
 Why do transport systems lead to such misery, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent or is something more fundamental at work?
 Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
 Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent way; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
 To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the roadway.
 Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
 This gives them a wider selection of small hiding places in which they can hide from predators.
 Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system.
 Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth.
 That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the earth is moving, does it?
 The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
 As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
 The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical perfection of their construction.
 Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
 The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
 The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
 Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
 Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as all of them can be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
 Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
 This corresponded to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
 There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
 The universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 Consequently, the pencil after its invention became a good friend to many people.
 Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
 Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter.
 One can only wait and see what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along.
 The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
 It is like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. When the core is split again, some of this energy is released.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest touch or even without any touch at all.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
 It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands.
 On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 In content theories, the focus is on finding what moves or appeals to people.
 These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood.
 These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
 This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding employees accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, you become a completely different individual, who has to do everything differently than the team has done and take everything for granted.
 Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
 Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local management.
 The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 "The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
 Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively utilized across all functional areas of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
 As a result, the joint work of an organization on overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs.
 Before an organization can be innovative, management must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus delimiting the research area and making it much more precise.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
 Emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
 It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
 AI is strongly associated with science fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
 Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Examples include control, setting up strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
 Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to problems of real life.
 The AI system is now often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
 Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her or his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
 Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
 Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web site about their trip to the state capital each year. The site is redesigned each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
 Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
 Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
 Blogging "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to engage the interest of the audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
 The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
 Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled beauty of nature stretches out in Muskoka and beyond.
 All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders see as typically Canadian.
 Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canada has citizens.
 The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of animal life, a separate continent.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
 The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
 European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
 In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
 Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed, etc.
 Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences be damned; that doesn't mean it's OK!)
 The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, before the beginning of the Common Era, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
 The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
 Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
 Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of Tinnef are sold, but that is all for the tourists.
 Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center, under itself.
 While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to stay abreast of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
 The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
 You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.x
 This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has led to the metaphorical use of the name "Timbuktu" for exotic, distant countries.
 Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor city.
 In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desertification.
 It was one of the most important stops of Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
 The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
 The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
 The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different animal life.
 It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
 Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
 It may also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
 Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
 The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering bar chart, visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
 For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
 Most of the urbanization of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
 This is the place the British colonists made their own, and if you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and stretch 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
 The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests are not only mangrove swamps, however – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges Delta.
 The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
 The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
 As the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
 Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
 The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
 Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
 The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction works were completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic was not until March 2017.
 The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
 The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
 Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
 The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
 Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
 The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
 Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.x
 Information on competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
 The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the Islands and at Stanley Credit Cards are also often accepted.
 On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is accepted.
 It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the Islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
 Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures of over +30 °C are common.
 Winter can be deceptively cool: Temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
 Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
 According to the Park Authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
 No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears and practically all large animals may seem, they can still attack.
 Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don’t keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them enough space.
 Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep your camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa and is located on the island of Upolu. It has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The harbor was the scene of an inglorious standoff of the Navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
 All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
 During the Mau-Movement organised independence struggle, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
 As Auckland stretches over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade, provided by Pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
 There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
 The most important local beer is “Number One”. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
 There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more palatable.
 The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
 "For Australians, the idea of a flat white is foreign. A small black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino is topped high with foam (not milk) and tea is served without milk."
 Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
 Many diving trips take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
 However, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and especially pay attention to safety warnings.
 Jellyfish occur in the vicinity of beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this time period.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
 Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
 A booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay upon his arrival at the destination.
 Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agency.x
 Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
 They can also hold your reservation for you, in case you need time to think about the offer or to get additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
 Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
 At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
 Remember that there will still be music playing on parts of the festival until late into the night, even after the music has stopped on the main stages.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite horrible noise for the most affected.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
 Casinos are usually very concerned about keeping guests on site for as long as possible and spending a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
 They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to make sure they stay.
 Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
 Whoever wants to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should reckon with snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
 On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you can not drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
 In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that one can get stuck.
 The visibility may also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
 On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
 Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
 The term safari in common usage refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can see them better with a telescope.
 A walking safari (also called a bush walk, trek or footing) is a walking tour that lasts either a few hours or several days.
 The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place at other venues throughout Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having already hosted the 1964 Games.
 If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but by late March, most cancellation policies were not in effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
 It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket costing around 7,000¥.
 Drying damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
 If an iron is not available or one does not want to wear ironed socks, one can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
 Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
 There are various methods of water purification. Some of them prove to be more effective in countering certain hazards.
 In some areas, it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
 The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
 Travellers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
 Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, poison or transmit diseases.
 Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with violence are not usually classified as pests.
 Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from certain taxes and consumption taxes in certain places.
 Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
 The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, uninhabited terrain.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves prevail here.
 The speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
 But interestingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as are those of southern neighbour Austria.
 Fruit cake is widespread, with apples being sold as cake all year round and cherries and plums being used in summer.
 Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
 A curry is a dish that is based on spices and herbs, along with either meat or vegetables.
 A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid used.
 In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
 With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 However, when used without further attributes, the term generally refers to the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The Javanese prefer nuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
 Spurs are aids for the feet of the rider, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
 They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet can possibly get caught in them.
 If a rider falls off a horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse goes through. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
 First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
 In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
 The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
 The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
 Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to one's feet and slides down a snow-covered surface.
 Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as “ski bums”, who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a particular location.
 The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
 The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was founded by Norwegians.
 Ski hiking with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
 It is similar to alpine touring skiing, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter is done in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
 Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
 In good conditions, you are able to cover somewhat longer distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for several visas and go through several passport controls if one wanted to travel through several countries.
 The Schengen area, however, works in this respect a little like a country.
 As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
 Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
 There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
 The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
 Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
 Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
 Even in the past, not all Sámi have raised reindeer in large numbers, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities. They kept reindeer mainly as draft animals.
 Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
 "Even if the term 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma."
 If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 You can also consult the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Briefings are only a short summary of the political situation in a country.
 The views presented are often superficial, general and overly simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
 Weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
 Weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of weather that depend on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are forms and effects of weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water hoses and whirlwinds.
 Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
 Travellers are urged to pay attention to any type of weather that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
 Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
 A search on the Internet for ""Course on hostile environments"" will probably display the address of a local company.
 A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
 A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
 There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but only a few publications on war zones.
 Travellers planning to have gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
 The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
 The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
 The searches at security checks have also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
 Transgender people before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when passing through the scanners.
 Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, often at reefs or the like.
 Because of the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there, even down to deep water.
 Most deaths occur from exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
 When you get out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
 Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
 The re-entry shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
 Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
 When you come back from a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have dropped some of your home culture's behaviours.
 When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adjust to a new country.
 One might not expect that even returning travelers need patience and understanding.
 The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
 Normally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The history of the sounds and the light is just like a story book.
 The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
 The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
 The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations, with sixteen active in 2020.
 The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
 Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
 In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
 A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in clear sight of a satellite to make a call.
 The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice communications.
 Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about the connection to this service.
 An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year out is to study and take courses abroad.
 This is especially popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without their studies being affected.
 In many cases, participation in an overseas bridge year program can actually improve your chances of getting into college in your home country.
 Usually, a fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
 Finland is a great destination for boating. The “Land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
 For the Archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
 Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
 Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with every sixth or eighth person owning a boat.
 This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
 Most pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
 This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days, while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
 If you only go on land excursions during the Bordex, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
 Some cruises advertise Berlin in Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Flying can be a frightening experience for people of any age and from any walk of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
 There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
 Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear that comes with the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
 Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often the time is a very important factor in business documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
 On some routes, the larger firms use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller firms, difficulties arose.
 When they shipped things by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
 The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. The airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
 The obvious method of flying first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better still, get your company to pay for it).
 This is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and up to eleven times the economy fare for first class!
 In general, it is pointless to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money and demand corresponding prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
 In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
 Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
 The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
 The once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and business-oriented metropolis, situated on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
 The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th century market as well as old mosques and churches, although the city radiates more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than the traditional Turkey.
 The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
 On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of pigeons on some graves.
 It is worthwhile to stroll through the fascinating village for half an hour.
 To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its beauty in vivid colours.
 The Scotturb-Bus 403 runs regularly over Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
 Also visit in the north the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place world famous for its Marian apparitions.
 Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave as well as a place that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
 There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
 Please treat this site with the dignity, respect and reverence it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
 Do not deface the site by putting up or scratching graffiti.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants speak Catalan, the great majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
 Most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the official language.
 Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
 Normal announcements are made in Catalan on the metro, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
 Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Even if this is often only an inaccurate cliché, one finds oneself in Paris best if one shows one's best side and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it much easier to get along.
 The brusque exterior of the Parisian quickly disappears when you show basic manners.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, fir and pine trees, and offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes.
 The area is also home to a very large diversity of animal and bird species.
 There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and hawks, as well as many species that are generally more common.
 When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and cover their shoulders.
 In most monasteries there are indeed wrap dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
 Similarly, men must wear pants that reach over the knees.
 These can also be borrowed from the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these dresses. For all men there is a standard size!
 The cuisine of Majorca is based, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
 A simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
 "All nouns start with a capital letter next to the word Sie for ""you"" even in the middle of a sentence."
 This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
 It makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because one has to determine whether a verb or a noun is used as the main word.
 Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
 The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
 "Also, pay attention to the difference between r and rr: caro means ""love"" while carro means ""chariot"".
 Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
 Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand the sentences better.
 If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
 People who speak some Spanish might be tempted to think that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
 Pre-modern observatories are nowadays normally no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
 Since light pollution was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in more recent times.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 The concept originated in China, where peach blossoms are the flower of choice.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
 "Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even one."
 If you visit a formally laid out garden and take "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and you can find almost everything you need after you arrive.
 Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to reckon with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
 There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
 Make sure that the bus you take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
 For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
 They also represent popular hiking and biking routes.
 In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
 Many of the traditions around the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
 There is a tradition of spending Easter night at some open place to see the sunrise.
 There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
 Traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations often beginning at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
 All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or being washed ashore.
 Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main prey on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
 This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is more or less dark all night.
 Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
 Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
 Suits are part of the standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
 Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being on group performance rather than on praising individual achievements.
 Often, workers have to seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
