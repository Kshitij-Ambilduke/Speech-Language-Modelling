 In Greece, in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, there have been found remains of sewage systems.
 In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, the toilet was sometimes included in the public baths,
 To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
 The launch of the satellite into space is done with a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere distorts and blurs the view.
 To carry a satellite or a telescope into space, a rocket must be more than 100 feet high.
 The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the most important is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
 Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile and several other means of transportation have come into existence.
 Below them are other medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to hares and deer.
 There are many small cats, including feral cats, which prey on small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The concept of a niche is the secret of their success, a particular niche that each cat has and that allows them to not compete with each other.
 Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
 The males are composed of adult males, usually two or three,
 Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
 The lion's behaviour is very much like that of the Wolf or dog, whose behaviour is in fact surprisingly analogous to that of the lion,

 Ocelots love to eat small animals, and if possible, they go after monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds,
 Scientists believe that Ocelots follow and find their prey by smelling it on the ground where it has been.
 Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, and are also able to move around stealthily.
 When a small group of living things separates from the main population to which it belongs,
 This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to stand out as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those that were necessary in the past.
 The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 As time goes on and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
 At a certain point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they will no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
 The process of speciation is inevitable and is a fundamental element of evolution.
 Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide that is exhaled by them.
 Plants make their own food by using the sunlight through a process called Photosynthesis.
 We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food that we eat is made from plants.
 The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its era and, as such, feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.

 Although most of their foods would seem familiar to us, the Roman banquets also featured several unfamiliar or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the hare.
 Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate while seated on chairs, the rich men loved to feast together while reclining on a couch.
 And the foods that we eat today are not the same as the foods that our ancestors ate thousands of years ago.
 For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes or cacao, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
 The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the deity's home.
 People brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.

 The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film format at the end of the analogue era.
 It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the sensor sizes of Digital cameras.
 And the height of the 35 mm is 24 mm and the width is 36 mm.
 The proportions of this format, dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers,
 The proportions of many of the common form factors, such as the family of APS form factors,
 The much-maligned rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
 Second, the most effective place to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally.
 In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful,
 The Christian religion had acted as a glue between the European States for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and custom.
 His all-pervading power has influenced everyone from the King to the common people.
 One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist for that very purpose.
 The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to ask if this principle has been respected.
 Soon after the beginning of the war, Britain decided to enact a naval blockade of Germany.
 The strategy proved effective the blockade was intended to disrupt any and all military and civilian supplies,
 Britain mined the international waters to prevent the access of any ship to entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
 Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine campaign.
 In the nineteen twenty s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.

 In ancient China, the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way,
 The period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty is known as the three kingdoms period,
 In these periods, between many nobles in lotta per il trono si accesero guerre feroci.
 The period of the three kingdoms was one of the most violent in the history of ancient China,
 The social and political effects are numerous, among these are the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the Republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
 And after the Revolution, the professions were open to all candidates, men, allowing the most ambitious and the most fortunate to succeed.
 The same is true of the military, since the Army's rank system is now based on caliber instead of class.
 The French Revolution was a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolutions.
 But Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this life.
 The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear image of the spirituality of Muhammad.
 The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
 In reality, it's not at all easy to find, even though it's known to exist.
 There is nothing to be seen or heard from the interior of the cave,

 To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of this order.
 The period in which these events took place is commonly called the high Middle Ages,
 The high Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which end around the year one thousand.
 Determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the narrow sense of the word,
 The two main ideas that are shared by most of the interpretations of technological determinism are that the development of technology follows a path that is very much beyond political and cultural effects,
 For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
 However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, and new methods of production are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
 The possession of mass automobiles also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new techniques for the care of injured people.
 The romanticism was characterized by a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 And in the course of time, usages, customs and culture have emerged from it,
 Similarly, as Paris is nowadays the world's fashion capital,
 Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100.
 During the twelfth century, its prestige declined, especially because the crusaders returned with goods such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the goods that the Byzantine markets offered.
 At this point, the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
 The height of the Gothic style was reached between the X and the XI century,
 Initially, the clothing was influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
 But the slowness of communication means that the styles take 25 to 30 years to spread.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the time was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
 Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 The agriculture of subsistence is a simple system, usually of the biological type, which uses seeds originally from the region,
 Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, it's still the case.
 Underground cultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the mainstream society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, and or the gender of its members.
 The characteristics that define a subculture may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style,
 One of the most common methods of explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect,
 These children are called feral or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people,
 Feral children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
 Other children may have been raised by animals, and still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
 When a feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviors almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
 The project based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffolding goes a bit beyond that.
 Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a support for those who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 The scaffolding can be both virtual and real . In other words, a teacher is an example of scaffolding, but so is the little assistant in Microsoft office.
 The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and have the purpose of interrogating, soliciting and explaining the procedures that the student may have had difficulty in managing on their own.
 The children are given up for various reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even to extortion.
 A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide nutrition, care, and education, but to them it happens.
 We believe that the foster care system is a safe place for these children.
 Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
 It is supposed that the affidavit will supply all the necessities not supplied in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet combines some of the characteristics of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
 The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to supplementary dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications theory.
 For example, as important motivations for using the Internet are suggested learning and socialization.
 The study by Eighmey and McCord, two new aspects of motivation were identified, namely, personal involvement and continuing relationships.
 The use of Video-Recordings has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of Micro-Expressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
 In the specific, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting the micro expressions.
 In his book, the man who mistook his wife for a hat,
 He even goes so far as to suggest that these abilities to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as dogs.
 In the twentieth century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability,
 With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, and with selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
 Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability forward and backward between the two pools.
 For a primate with an analogous digestive apparatus to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available in the savanna.
 In addition, the lack of these activities has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, in the end, even death.
 The most easily accessible vegetable resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us,
 And the foods of the animal Kingdom are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a high percentage of proteins,
 In the light of all this, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their own protein problem in a way that is very similar to how our own ancestors solved theirs.
 The interruption of sleep is the intentional process of waking up during the normal period of sleep, which is followed by a resumption of sleep.
 This process can be easily put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness,
 If you decide to reset the clock while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other biorhythm-focused options include the consumption of many fluids before going to bed, especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties,
 A person enjoys a peace of mind proportionate to the tension existing in his body and in his spirit.
 The less tension, the more positive is the vital force that exists in each one of us.
 Everyone can reach enlightenment . This goal is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
 The Tibetan form of Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the love teachings of the Mahayana and by various Indian yoga techniques.
 In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
 Kundalini yoga activates the Kundalini energy through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, Mantras, and visualizations.
 The Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation, whereby the Deities are visualized,
 The two countries have been at odds since the end of the war,
 Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies, and the cold war began.
 It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought by mercenary armies,
 On September 17, the Polish defense had already been broken through, and the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans proved obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Army troops advanced and created the Belorussian and the Ukrainian fronts,
 Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
 The Navy has always had the task of ensuring that the country can move its people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from doing the same.
 One of the most notable examples of this is the battle of the Atlantic during the second World War.
 At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly U-Boats,
 If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain,
 And it seems that goats were first domesticated around ten thousand years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
 They were first raised by cultures and tribes of the ancient world to have easily available milk, wool, meat, and leather.
 Goats were usually kept in herds that were allowed to roam freely on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds,
 Already in the sixteenth century, in England, wagonways were built.
 Wagonways, although they were simply made of wooden rails,
 The rails were introduced relatively early on to keep the rails in position, but gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had a top iron bar.
 It became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear to the wooden wheels of the cars.
 And finally, in the eighteenth century, the first iron wheels were introduced.
 The first means of transportation that mankind has known are the legs.
 His predecessor, the Australopithecus,
 And signs of bipedalism are present in the Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago,
 To try to mitigate in some way the future sufferings, we can start to adopt lifestyles that are more respectful of the environment,
 In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we want a permanent solution, we should find the root cause and dismantle it.
 It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
 After the Congress adopted it on July four, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson,
 In the night, between one hundred and two hundred copies were produced, and are now known as the Dunlap editions.
 The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence hall,
 One was sent to George Washington on the 6th of July, which he read to his troops in New York on the 9th of July,
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that exist today are the oldest known copies of the document,
 According to many paleontologists of today, one category of dinosaurs is still alive,
 Many tend to not consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
 And yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
 Like the T-Rex, they have feet with claws and they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
 In the end, the manipulation of information coded in the form of Binary numbers is at the heart of all computers in use today.
 A Binary number can have only one of two values, zero or one, and in the technical language of computing, these numbers are called Binary digits or bits.
 The internal poisoning may not be immediately evident, and its symptoms, including vomiting, are so general as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
 The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or of noxious chemicals.
 Check the label to see if it has first aid instructions for that specific poison.
 The term arachnoid is used by entomologists for this group of insects.
 The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have become highly adapted to become parasites of man.
 Both bed bugs and assassin bugs are nidicolous, which means they are adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis,
 The SM is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Research has shown that the chances of developing MS are twice as high in women as in men.
 A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of their own child.
 And the parents have the option of choosing a plan for their child.
 In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
 The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most of the scientific inquiry.
 But it is not only experimentation that is involved in research, for experimentation is only a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
 The opinions of Aristotle on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology,
 With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 In many, it has been observed that the physiological rhythms and the behavior depend in a determinant way from the presence of endogenous cycles and from their production through the biological clocks.
 There have been documented periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to periodic external signals,
 Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
 One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that of Hershey and Chase.
 Hershey and Chase used bacteriophage,
 They have performed two experiments, highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of Mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved,
 The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those that occur in the germ cells,
 The naturalist tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
 Among the activities to be done on the spot are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and the study of information regarding the ecosystem.
 For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
 Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work, and they meet other people on the way to work who are coming from the same place they have just left.
 In this dynamic back and forth, everyone is in some way connected to a system of transportation that is based on private cars,
 Today, science reveals that this massive, carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere beyond one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
 Everyone participates in the social life and uses the transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
 In the developed countries, it's rare to hear such levels of complaint about the quality of water or the bridges that are falling apart.
 Why do the transportation systems attract so many complaints? are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
 The traffic flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions that they generate with each other.
 Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
 Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range,
 In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated as follows:
 These relationships are useful in planning, designing, and managing road structures.
 Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and the ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects are advantageously equipped with wings that can be folded along the body.
 This allows them to take advantage of a wider variety of small crevices in which to hide from predators.
 Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are the dragonflies and the damselflies.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
 For some, it was right, for many others, it was wrong, and the earth was stationary,
 And the earth is not moving, no?
 The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river in the world, carrying eight times the amount of water that the second largest river carries.
 The Amazon is also the widest River in the world, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
 The total amount of water that the rivers of the planet carry to the oceans is twenty percent of the total water that the rivers carry.
 The river Amazon is the longest river in the world, and it is the largest river in the world in terms of the volume of water it carries.
 Pyramids were built in stone until the end of the old Kingdom, but despite this, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical excellence.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were still in awe of the monuments of their ancestors, who were by then over a thousand years old.
 The Vatican city is the smallest independent country in the world, with a population of about eight hundred people.
 The language of the Vatican city for legislation and official communications is Italian.
 Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people who work within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
 In the Vatican city, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
 Man has been aware of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times,
 According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
 These in fact are more like the four states of matter, namely, solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma.
 The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals . keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
 The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
 There may also be alloys composed of very small quantities of Non-Metals, such as carbon.
 In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
