 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that,
 Gold can be given any shape.
 It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and wound into a coil.
 It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books,
 It's called pH, the measure of how acidic or basic a substance is.
 Cucumber juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
 The pH is a measure of the degree to which the ions of hydrogen are saturated in a chemical compound.
 Ions are atoms that have had electrons removed from them, leaving only the protons.
 Mix two dry powders in one container, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball from this mixture.
 The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will form a kind of a coating.
 In almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro there was a toilet with a flushing system connected to a complex sewage system.
 The surviving fragments of the sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the Islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would bathe together.
 When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
 A satellite is delivered to space by a rocket . scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and our view.
 For a satellite or telescope to be launched into space, a giant rocket is needed,
 The wheel has changed our world in many ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
 It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
 Underneath them are larger cats, which eat prey of a larger size, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
 And finally, many small cats, including the ones that live in our homes, eat and hunt much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each kind of cat does,
 Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
 A pride consists of one to three adult males, who are related, and also of the females and their young, which may number up to thirty.
 The females are usually in a state of kinship with each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lions behave very much like a pack of wolves or dogs,
 Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees, although not very well,
 Tigers belong to the same family as lions, tigers, and jaguars,
 A tiger's roar is not quite as full-bodied as a lion's roar,
 Ocelots love to eat small animals, and if they have the chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
 Scientists believe that the Ocelots follow the scent of the prey,
 They can see in the dark, using nocturnal vision, and can move almost unseen,
 When a small group of living organisms, a small population, is separated from the main population from which it came,
 This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or changes from what it had before,
 The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations it always needed.
 Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
 Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that you couldn't tell they were the same species.
 We call this process the formation of new species,
 Plants produce the oxygen that we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
 Plants are powered by the sun through Photosynthesis, and they also cast shade.
 We build our homes and make our clothes from plants . Most of our food is from plants.
 The Mosasaurus was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one but other Mosasaurs.
 His long jaws were lined with more than seventy sharp teeth, and he had a set of fangs on his palate,
 We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was split in two, and he ate turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs.
 He also attacked anything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus,
 Despite the fact that most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans had some strange and unusual dishes,
 At the same time, the rich people ate while sitting on chairs, and the poor people ate while lying on their sides.
 The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that were introduced to Europe in the following centuries.
 In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no chicken.
 The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple,
 People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the desires of the gods at ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
 Sometimes, as elements of the temple, they built special towers in the form of pyramids called Zikkurats.
 The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.

 Women prepared food in the yard, and shops were open shops with goods displayed on the street.
 There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Scandinavian Sagas it is said that Erik the Red was driven out of Iceland for murder,
 But even before this discovery, the Inuit people were already living there.
 Although each of the three countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you've seen the movie National treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence had a map of treasure on the back.
 But the truth is, there is no map to the treasure.
 On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence it says, in the bottom,
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document,
 And so it's possible that the note was added simply as a marker.
 In the end, the Allies were able to liberate all of France, but the war was not yet over.
 He was under the control of the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France,
 In just two weeks, the French and Americans had liberated all of Southern France and were on their way to Germany.
 A civilization is a large group of people living and working together, a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen,
 Cities are the precursors of nations, and a civilization is a transmission of knowledge through several generations,
 Small cultures often disappear without leaving a trace, and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
 During the war of independence, thirteen States, in accordance with the articles of Confederation,
 The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority,
 He also had no power to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
 To pass the amendments, unanimous approval from all of the States was required, but the States were so unresponsive to the central government that their representatives often were absent.
 The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world, and won the FIFA world cup in two thousand and six.

 Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the sun temple, and the three windows room.
 Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they looked originally.
 By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
 The most common format for static photographs is 35 mm, and this is the dominant size of film on the cusp of the analogue era.
 Today it's still made, but more importantly, the aspect ratio of its image is what we use today for the aspect ratio of Digital cameras.
 The thirty five millimeter format is actually somewhat confusing, it has a width of thirty six millimeters and a height of twenty four millimeters.
 The ratio of the two sides of this format, divided by twelve,
 Many common formats, such as the APS family,
 Too often used and often derided as a rule of thirds,
 The best place for the main object is at the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into three parts, vertically and horizontally.
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful,
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the European States, despite differences in languages and traditions.
 Her all-pervading power has touched every one, from the King to the commoner.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money should be used for that purpose.
 The center of church power was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and that concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether that doctrine was being upheld.
 Soon after the start of the war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
 This strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international laws that had been established in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
 Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sectors of the oceans, putting even neutral ships at risk.
 And the British were not going to allow this to happen again, so they were going to be very careful about their own submarine warfare.
 Amongst most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, there were prevailing sentiments such as pacifism and isolation.
 And so, in the wake of the first World War,
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job working for Edison in New York City.
 He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from his previous employer, Thomas Edison,
 In ancient China, they had a unique way of naming periods of time,
 And between each dynasty there was a period of disunity and instability,
 During this period, there were fierce military actions between many noble people who were fighting for the throne.
 The era of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China,
 There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolute Monarchy to Republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
 Also, after the Revolution, opportunities opened up to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
 The same thing applies to the Army, because the ranks were based on merit, not on birth.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 And he was very interested in topics that were not related to worldly life,
 The cave, which has been preserved to this day,
 The cave is located at the top of a mountain to the North of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 It's very hard to find even for someone who knows about it,
 You see nothing but a pure, beautiful sky above you and a multitude of surrounding mountains,
 The great pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
 The great pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of a pharaoh.
 The plateau of Giza, or the Necropolis of Giza, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids,
 The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
 The sign for upward movement is a V, and the sign for downward movement is a square with no bottom.
 The up bow mark looks like a V and the down bow mark looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
 The upward movement of the smycg produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a louder and more percussive sound.
 You can draw your own shading, but remember, shading is printed for musical reasons, and it's usually best to follow it.
 On the sixth of October, seventeen eighty nine, a furious crowd of women from the market,
 They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the King and queen.
 The crowd of people forced the King and the queen to open the windows wide.
 At one point, a member of the crowd waved a severed head of a Royal Guardsman killed in Versailles.
 The military expenditures of the American empire to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
 They were forced to pay the American colonial regime,
 Of course, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main source of the American empire.
 To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to their creation.
 The period of time in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that spans the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries.
 The high Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological determinism to a strict view that the destiny of human beings is governed by the underlying logic of science and its manifestation in technology.
 Most views of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually impervious to cultural or political influence,
 For example, you might say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
 However, the national road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of vehicles, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
 Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating the injuries that are received.
 Romanticism in many ways included cultural determinism, which was borrowed from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture emerged that were better suited to the place of residence of a given society than the laws that were imposed from above.
 Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, just as Constantinople was called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
 His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the crusaders were returning with goods such as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
 At this point, the title of fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its height between the X and the fourteenth centuries.
 At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
 But because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag by as much as twenty five to thirty years.
 Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages,
 Organic farming is agriculture that is practiced for the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 Organic farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture, using seeds from plants that grow in the given ecosystem,
 Historically, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for the purpose of food production, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
 Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel alienated by mainstream society, and allow such people to define themselves.
 There may be differences between subcultures, based on age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and or gender.
 Characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political,
 Representatives of a certain subculture often declare their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, manners, and slang.
 One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate a few unfortunate cases where children,
 Some of these children were isolated from people, usually their own parents,
 Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of abuse or trauma before they ran away or were abandoned.
 Some were raised by animals, some were said to have lived in the wild.
 If he is completely reared by animals instead of people, a wild child demonstrates in all respects the habits of the animal that reared him,
 And while project-based learning is easier and more interesting, Scratch-Based learning is ahead of many other technologies.
 Skill-Building is not a method of teaching, but rather a form of assistance to those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Skillshare is a place where you can learn anything from anyone,
 Virtual scaffolding, which helps in the teaching, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that the student might otherwise find too difficult to cope with on their own.
 Children are passed on to care by a variety of reasons, from being abandoned to being abused, from being neglected to being abused.
 Children should not be raised in an environment where they are not being educated, cared for, and educated, but they are.
 We consider the foster care system safe for children.
 Our system of care should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
 The care and nurture should provide all the necessities which were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet combines elements of both mass and face-to-face communication.
 Distinguishing features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of the approach to and the way of using and satisfying.
 So, for example, it has been suggested that learning and socialization are important motivating factors for using the Internet.
 And personal involvement and long-term contact were also called for by Eimmi and McCorquodale,
 The use of the Video-Tape led to important discoveries in the field of Micro-Expression,
 In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by the correct interpretation of his or her micro expressions.
 In the article, the President, Oliver Sacks, described how people who are unable to understand speech,
 According to his theory, animals, such as dogs,
 Research that was done in the twentieth century showed that there are two kinds of genetic variability,
 Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection weeds it out of the set of variations that are being expressed.
 Segregation and recombination with each generation tune the variations between two pools.
 In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like ours have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
 More than that, failure to do so will lead to things like stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The most available plant resources would be the nuts and seeds found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us if they are not cooked.
 Food of animal origin, on the other hand, is not only easily digested,
 Given all of the above, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do it in the savannah.
 Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up during a normal sleep and then falling asleep again after a short time period of 10 to 60 minutes.
 This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock,
 If you find yourself setting the alarm clock in your dream, then you can set it on the other side of the room,
 Other options, which are based on biological rhythms, include the intake of large quantities of water or tea, a known diuretic, before going to bed, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
 The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
 The lower the voltage, the more positive is the life force that is present in you.
 Everyone can achieve enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negative attitude.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
 The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
 Kundalini energy in Kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, Mantras, and visualization.
 The heart of Tibetan meditation is the visualization of various deities,
 Germany was a common enemy in the second World War, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
 Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the cold war began.
 It was to last for the next forty years, and it was to be fought out in real, direct, and bloody wars,
 By the 17th of September, the Polish defence had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and the Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of Eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
 The use of ships for the transportation of goods is, by far, the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
 The work of the seamen traditionally has been to provide the ability of a country to move its people and goods,
 One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic, where the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic ocean to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy, using its U-Boats,
 If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
 Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves, in order to have milk, wool, meat, and fur.
 Domestic goats were usually kept in herds, which wandered over hills or other places of pasture, which were usually watched by children or adolescents,
 Roads were built in England as early as the sixteenth century.
 Although the roads were only parallel wooden beams, they gave the horses the ability to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than the more rutted roads of the time.
 The ties were first used to hold the rails in place, but it soon became clear that the rails were more effective with a layer of iron on top.
 This became a common practice, but the iron wheels led to more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the trains.
 And the first iron rails were made entirely of iron,
 The first known form of transportation was walking, people started to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus.
 For their ancestors, Australopithecus, upright walking was not so common.
 Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus from the 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although, perhaps, Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
 We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can become members of the environmental movement,
 As a rule, it's like treating the symptoms, not the root cause of the problem.
 It's obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of mankind's scientific and technological progress,
 After the bill was signed by President John Adams,
 For the next few days, the leaflets were distributed by the thousands, and were known as the Dana papers.
 The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence hall on July eight.
 On July six, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July nine ordered it to be read to his troops in New York.
 The twenty five D'Anville copies that are known today are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
 Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived on to our day,
 Often they are not considered to be dinosaurs, because they have feathers and are able to fly.
 But there are still many things we don't know about birds, which still look like dinosaurs.
 They have claws and teeth, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
 Almost all the computers that are in use today are based on the processing of information that is coded in Binary.
 A Binary number can have only one of two values, zero or one, and these are called Binary digits or bits.
 It may be difficult to spot oral poisoning at first, symptoms like vomiting are too common to be a quick diagnosis.
 The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with a medicine or a toxic household chemical.
 Read the label, which gives you specific instructions for first aid in the event of this particular poison.
 The term beetle is used by entomologists to refer to the order Coleoptera,
 The term comes from the ancient belief that bed bugs are well adapted to parasitize on humans.
 And the two are not always the same . Some are both,
 In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis,
 Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
 Research has shown that two times more women than men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
 A couple may decide that raising a child does not fit their interests or the interests of their child.
 These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
 When a child is adopted or adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
 The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is put together, using the scientific method.
 But he is not the only one to have done so . scientific research is also guided by experimentation, asking questions and making observations.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on the ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in the Latin language.
 In all the sciences, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were accepted.
 As the knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
 Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms, not just a response to external periodic stimuli, are registered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate autonomously for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
 Hershey and Chase were one of the first to suggest that DNA was the genetic material.
 Hersh and Chase implanted their DNA in a bacterium with the help of Phages,
 They performed two experiments, tagging the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of the phage with radioactive Selenium.
 Mutations can cause a wide variety of results, depending on the type of Mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether or not the Mutated cells are in the embryonic lineage.
 Mutations in the cells of the embryo can only be passed on to the child's cells, whereas mutations elsewhere may lead to the death of the cell or cancer.
 And natural tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape,
 Among the examples of active recreation at the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching,
 The visit, the photographing, and the study of orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and cars drive by them on their way to their place of work.
 In this active transportation system, everyone is connected to the system in some way or another,
 At the present time, science indicates that a huge hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere,
 Everyone is a member of the society and uses the transportation systems,
 In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
 Why do transportation systems fail so often? Why do they break down daily?
 The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of a study of transport flows.
 It's hard to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict with one hundred percent certainty how a driver is going to behave.
 Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is often quite systematic, so that traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated by mathematics.
 In order to better represent the transportation flow, the following three main variables were established: 1. flow,
 These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railroad facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape predators, find food and find mates.
 Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
 This provides them with more places to hide from predators.
 Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 Many believed him, but many believed the opposite, that the sun, the moon, and even the stars,
 This seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the earth moving, do we?
 The Amazon is the second longest and the first largest river on earth,
 The Amazon is also the widest River on earth, with a width of up to six miles at times.
 As much as twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans,
 The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers long.
 Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the old Kingdom,
 In the new Kingdom of ancient Egypt, monuments created by their predecessors were admired.
 The Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world, with a population of about eight hundred people.
 The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
 Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
 People from ancient times were aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they could all be found in nature in a pure form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of one or more of four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
 They were in the same order as the four states of matter we know today, solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also suggested that they changed into a new state.
 Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals, and remember there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals, of course, and there are also metals such as silver and gold.
 You can also make alloys that contain a small amount of Non-Metallic elements, such as carbon.
 The universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly tiny that three trillion of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 And so the pencil became a good friend to many people when it first came out.
 It's sad that when new ways of writing came, the pencil lost its old status and was used less and less.
 Nowadays, people write messages on the screens of computers, and they never have to deal with a typewriter.
 One can only guess what will become of the keyboard with the advent of newer technologies.
 The atom bomb works on the principle that in order for a lot of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus,
 It's like a heavy cart being rolled up a hill, and then the energy is released when the cart is rolled back down.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to decay at little or no impact.
 The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
 The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and about 100 km under the continents.
 It is thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the highlands.
 On the visible side, there may be more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner, and lava was easier to rise to the surface.
 Theories of content are concentrated on finding out what makes people act or may interest them.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and or desires that accumulate within them as they mature.
 These theories look at what makes particular people want to do the things they do and what makes their environment want to do or not do certain things.
 There are two popular theories about content, Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
 As a rule, there are two types of behavior when managers start to lead people who are previously equal to them in status.
 It's hard for them to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary action, to evaluate the work, to distribute responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks they have to change everything the team did and take credit for it.
 And the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
 This kind of behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as are the traditional teams,
 The virtual members of the team often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
 They're usually more autonomous than people from traditional teams, because their teams can meet up in different time zones,
 The presence of a real, invisible team is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 The invisible team is the team of leaders that each participant answers to.
