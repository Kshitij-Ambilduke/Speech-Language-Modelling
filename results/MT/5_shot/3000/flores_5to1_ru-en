 This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that can’t usually be obtained from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
 Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were above a chestnut-brown color, and from below - either pale, or had carotenoid pigmentation.
 The find also allows to get acquainted with the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Since the dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and whiskers - the researchers concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents the adult plumage, and not the down of a chicken.
 The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen has the plumage of an adult individual, and not the down of a chicken.

 The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
 The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the galaxy in Sagittarius.
 Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as it affects ordinary matter.
 According to this theory, a significant part of the dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

 In the course of research in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Tony Moll managed to find tuberculosis with exceptionally high resistance to drugs (XDR-TB).
 In an interview, he said the new strain "raises very big concerns, as it leads to a very high mortality rate".
 Some patients may have caught the infection in hospital, Dr Moll thinks, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
 In one year, an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 people in close contact.
 However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the whole group of tuberculosis patients still seems low; 6000 out of a total of 330 000 infected at a given moment in South Africa.

 In France, voting is traditionally carried out using low-tech methods: the voter closes himself in a booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate’s name into an envelope.
 After officials verify the voter's identity, he or she drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
 French election laws are quite strict in systematizing procedures.
 Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no other envelopes have been added to them other than those of the people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
 Candidates can send their representatives to watch the counting process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to a special procedure.

 In another race, this time in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the position of sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first Austrian Claudia Lesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth Hungarian Diengyi Dani.
 Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to finish.
 The police of Madhya Pradesh returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
 Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
 The accused have the names Babu Kandjar, Bhuta Kandjar, Rampro Kandjar and Vishnu Kandjar.
 Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
 Although there were three people inside the building at the time the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
 However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 The Edinburgh Sheriff Court subsequently charged Adekoye with the murder of her son.
 She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony she gives could be tainted because her celebrity has been widely exploited by the media.
 This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts found the publication of the photos to be potentially damaging.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists do seem to be treading a dangerous line in publishing photographs and other details of suspects".
 The Royal Prosecutor, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a verdict is handed down.
 The document, according to the leak, will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
 Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan River valley.
 Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
 The traps, which participated in the additional test for pests, had to be under the close supervision of rangers, as this test was conducted under observation and evaluated its effectiveness.
 As part of the partnership between NPWS and the NSW Sporting Shooters Association, a hunting program was run by the Sporting Shooters Association to recruit qualified volunteers.
 According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation parks and heritage of the Wildlife and National Parks Service, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation, underwent a comprehensive training and safety briefing.
 Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members.
 This is the fifth CEP Marty has won in four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous interim electoral council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
 The commission was Marcellus's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
 These sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to be held as early as 2011.
 About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPod devices have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
 Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving the devices.
 Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
 In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting "very regrettable".
 At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) there was an earthquake in Mariana.
 The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
 A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
 Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
 Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
 Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
 Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman, as she went to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
 Lighgins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
 He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 When Liggins worked in the hospital, in his free time he began to investigate cases of premature birth.
 His study showed that if you inject the hormone, it will enhance the maturation of the lungs of the child during the period of fetal development.
 According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes."
 Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the moon.
 Here's what Tommy Dreamer said: "The Moon was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. The Moon passed away on the night of the two moons. It's such a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
 Dustin "Goldie" Runnells said, "The moon was as infected as I was... Perhaps even more infected... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
 Of 1,400 people surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 per cent since 2008.
 Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
 The survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are sure that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness is now in doubt after he complained.
 He was unable to take painkillers, which are banned in the Games.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 opened the largest prime number known to date.
 On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
 Comets may have been the source of water delivery to Earth, as well as the source of organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
 Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets have been colliding with Earth for a very long time.
 Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
 He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense."
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow planes to fly more direct routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
 It uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
 No additional transport has been launched to Wembley, there will not be any stops for ground trains, in addition, there are no parking lots and parking lots on the surface.
 Fears over transportation have prompted speculation that the game could be played behind closed doors without fans.
 The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
 Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the transplanted cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
 Gold can be given any shape. It can be cast into very small forms.
 It can be stretched into a thin wire, which can be woven and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into rolls.
 It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called “facsimile manuscript”.
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
 Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
 The pH is determined by the degree of saturation of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under investigation.
 Hydrogen ions are protons, from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
 Get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then with clean wet hands, form a ball from this mixture.
 The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
 Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a flushing system connected to a complex sewage system.
 Remaining fragments of sewer systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
 When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
 The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
 To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall.
 The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
 It gave us the train, the automobile and many other vehicles.
 Under them are a greater number of medium-sized cats, which eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, many small cats (including stray house cats) eat and hunt much smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success lies in the concept of niche, a particular job that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
 Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
 The pride consists of one to three adult males related to each other, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach thirty.
 Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides behave very much like wolf or dog packs — animals that, in behavior, are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and also very dangerous to their prey.
 Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
 The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
 A tiger's roar is not like a full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a barking of sentences made up of unintelligible words.
 Ocelots love to eat small animals. If the opportunity arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
 Scientists believe that cats follow the scent of animals and find prey by smelling their movements on the ground.
 They are able to see very well in the dark with night vision and move almost invisibly, stalking their prey and then pouncing on it.
 When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
 This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
 The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
 Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to say that they are the same species.
 We call this process speciation, the production of new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of, and a crucial part of, evolution.
 Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
 Plants feed from the sun with the help of photosynthesis. In addition, they cast a shadow.
 We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
 His long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and he had an additional row of teeth on his palate, so that there was no escape for those who crossed his path.
 We do not know for sure, but it is not excluded that his tongue was divided. He ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and could be a cannibal.
 He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would not have been able to compete with him.
 Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange and unusual dishes, served at feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a hedgehog.
 There was another difference: while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have joint feasts, during which they ate lying on their sides.
 The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
 In particular, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman has not tried turkey.
 The Babylonians built a temple to each of the gods in their main sanctuary, which was considered the god's home.
 People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' wishes in ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
 Sometimes as elements of the temple were built special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurats".
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of particular importance.
 Much of the Jewish family’s life was spent outdoors.
 Women prepared in the yard; the shops were open shelves, which were open to the street. For the construction of houses used stone.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas it is told that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
 But regardless of his discovery, at that time there already lived the Eskimo tribes.
 Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence was illustrated with a map of treasures.
 However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 The Declaration of Independence reads: "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America, when signed, is dated July 4, 1776." The text is written upside down and back to front.
 Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for more convenient storage.
 So it is quite possible that the entry was added simply as a note.
 As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was not.
 It was under the control of the "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
 In just 2 weeks, the Free French and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
 Civilization is a separate culture, the carriers of which is a fairly large group of people living and working together, society.
 The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and is a relative of the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural presence and a successive spread.
 Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as authentic civilizations.
 During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government, the only body of which was the Congress.
 Congress had no taxing powers, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the states, which often refused to cooperate and refused to enforce its acts.
 He also had no authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
 To amend the articles, unanimous approval of all states is required, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
 The Italian football team, along with the German, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and "Formula One" motor racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. The inhabitants of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
 Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
 Due to its belonging to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called from a geographical point of view archipelago.
 Taiwan has its origins many years ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal methods of rice production and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they looked originally.
 By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the world’s most common format for still photography is 35mm, and it was this size that dominated the film market at the end of the analogue era.
 It is still produced today, but more importantly, it has inherited the aspect ratio of digital camera images.
 The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
 The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
 Many common formats (for example the APS family) are equal to or close to these proportions.
 The rule of thirds is too often used and often ridiculed, but it is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
 It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
 During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, was the object of close attention.
 For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
 Its all-pervasive power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
 One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money exists for this purpose.
 The center of church power was based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being observed.
 Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade of Germany.
 This strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws, as set out in several international agreements over the last two hundred years.
 Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
 As the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unimpeded submarine warfare.
 Among most citizens and nations in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
 Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted an offer to work for the Edison company in New York City.
 He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
 In ancient China, a unique way of marking time was used; each period of China or each family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
 In addition, between the reigns of each dynasty there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
 During this period there were fierce military actions between many noble people fighting for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
 There are many such social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
 Also after the Revolution opened up opportunities for work to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
 The same applies to the army, because ranks were based on qualities, not on origin.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection.
 And the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
 The cave is located on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 It is very difficult to find even for those who know about its existence, in the cave a person is in complete isolation.
 There is nothing but the pure beauty of the sky above and the surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
 The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the pharaoh.
 The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller pyramids, several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
 The sign of the movement of the bow up looks like V, and the movement of the bow down - as a hook or square without the lower side.
 "Up" means you should start at the tip and pull the bow forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand holds the bow and pull it back.
 The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more forceful sound.
 You can draw your own strumming pattern, but remember that the strumming pattern is printed for musical reasons, and it is usually worth following.
 On October 6, 1789, an angry crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
 They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
 The crowd of people made the King and Queen open the windows wide.
 At one point, one of the crowd waved to a royal guardsman killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
 The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bond issues moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
 Of course, the superprofits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main source of income of American imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted their creation.
 The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
 The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to a strict point of view that the fate of people is driven by fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
 Most views of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually impervious to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, rather than by society.
 For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
 However, the national road network is economically unprofitable only for a small group of cars, so new methods of production are being developed, which will reduce the cost of owning a car.
 Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods of treating the resulting injuries in healthcare.
 Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture arose that, being in harmony with the place of residence of this society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
 Just as Paris is called the capital of fashion in the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
 His fame as a center of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
 Its status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with such prized goods as silk and spices, which were more highly valued than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
 At this point, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
 At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
 However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25-30 years.
 Own styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
 Natural farming is farming that is done for the production of enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
 Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture using seeds from plants that grow in the given ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing crop yields.
 Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
 Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel oppressed by society's standards, and allow such people to define themselves.
 Subcultures may differ in terms of age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people who make up the subculture.
 The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of a subculture often declare their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
 One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their upbringing.
 Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some feral children have been isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such rejection of their child was the result of the parents' rejection of his or her serious intellectual or physical disability.
 Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of abuse or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
 Others, it is said, were reared by animals; some of them lived in a wild state by themselves.
 If he is fully raised by animals instead of humans, a feral child demonstrates behaviors (within the limits of physical constraints) in almost everything similar to the specific animal that raised him — for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
 While project-based learning should be easier and more engaging, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
 Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of assistance to those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Skaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of skaffolding, but so is a Screwpie in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual scaffolding, which helps in training, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the trainee might find too difficult to cope with alone.
 Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons, from vagrancy to abuse and even extortion.
 Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not provided with education, care and education, but grow up.
 We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
 Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
 Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
 The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
 The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach and satisfaction.
 Thus, the idea that "training" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)
 "Personal involvement" and "long-term contact" were also named by Eimmi and McCor-dle (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when they studied how people react to web sites.
 The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by means of a proper interpretation of his micro-expressions.
 In the article "The President's Speech" Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
 According to his assumption, such abilities to interpret human behavior can have animals, for example, domestic dogs.
 Studies conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
 Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection eliminates it from the set of manifest variations.
 Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffles the variations between the two pools.
 In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
 Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
 The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates such as ourselves if not cooked.
 In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins, containing all the basic amino acids.
 Taking into account all the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
 Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking during normal sleep and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10–60 minutes).
 This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
 If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, then you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of liquid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes the person to wake up to urinate.
 The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
 The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present in you. Every human being is potentially given the ability to attain absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
 Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
 The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
 The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The heart of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Deities. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness is enlightened.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the USSR and the United States. After the war, disagreements regarding the system, process and culture led to discord between the countries.
 Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
 It was to last the next 40 years. It was fought for real, using proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places around the world.
 By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
 The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
 The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, and to simultaneously prevent an enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
 One of the most notable recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
 If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
 Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to themselves to have at hand milk, wool, meat and fur.
 Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, which were often tended by children or adolescents, a practice that is still common today.
 Roads for carriages were built in England in the 16th century.
 Although the wagon roads were merely parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to carry larger loads and at higher speeds than the slightly more rutted roads of the time.
 Gaps began to be used quite a long time ago to keep the rails in place, but it later became clear that the paths were more effective with an iron strip on top.
 This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
 Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
 The first known form of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
 For their australopithecine ancestors, walking upright was not so common.
 Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although perhaps Sahelanthropus walked upright as early as 7 million years ago.
 We can start living more environmentally conscious lives. We can become members of the environmental movement and even become activists to help alleviate further suffering.
 This is usually like treating the symptoms. If we need not just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
 It is obvious that the world has changed a lot under the influence of scientific and technological progress of mankind, and due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people, the problems have become more serious.
 After the Congress's adoption on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
 150–200 copies were made overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
 The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
 On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
 The 25 known Donnelp leaflets are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
 Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs survived and lived to our days. We call them birds.
 They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
 But there is still much to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
 They have claws and teeth, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
 Almost all computers that are used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" —  or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
 It may be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
 The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
 Read the label, which will give specific instructions for first aid in case of poisoning with this particular poison.
 The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to the group of insects.
 This concept comes from the bed bugs, insects that have been known since ancient times and are well adapted to parasitize on humans.
 Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted for life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
 In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been diagnosed, making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged adults.
 Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
 Studies have shown that multiple sclerosis affects twice as many women as men.
 A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
 These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
 When a child is adopted or fostered, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
 The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is constructed, using the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific research.
 He, however, is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and making observations.
 Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
 In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were adopted.
 As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
 Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
 Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cycling over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
 The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium with the help of phages, i.e. viruses.
 They conducted two experiments, labeling radioactive phosphorus DNA phage and radioactive black phage protein.
 Mutations can cause a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected stretch of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
 Only mutations in the cells of the germ line can be passed on to the next generation, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
 Natural tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
 Among the examples of active recreation on the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
 An example is the visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and those whose place of work is in the place from which they have just left pass by them.
 In this active transportation movement, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a personal automobile-based transportation system.
 Science now indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
 Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Virtually everyone complains about these systems.
 In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or collapsing bridges.
 Why do transportation systems receive so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
 The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can not predict the behavior of the driver with 100% probability.
 Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often sufficiently systematic; thus, traffic flows as a whole have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
 To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between three main variables were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railroad facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies, find food and find mates.
 Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, giving them an advantage.
 This provides them with more hiding places in which to escape from predators.
 Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 Many believed him to be right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
 This seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
 The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second longest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that sometimes reaches six miles.
 As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
 The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza was never surpassed.
 In the new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians, they admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
 The Vatican City State has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
 The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
 Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
 Humans have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, though he also suggested that they transitioned into a new state to make what we see.
 Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
 It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
 Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of the smallest particles, called atoms.
 Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 Thus, the pencil became a good friend for many people when it appeared.
 It is sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and was used less.
 Now people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a typewriter.
 It is only a guess what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of more new technologies.
 The atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is needed.
 It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then the subsequent splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with or without little influence.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
 It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
 The visible side may have more lunar seas because the crust is thinner there. Lava was easier to rise to the surface.
 Content theories focus on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that build up inside them as they grow up.
 These theories address what causes particular individuals to want to do what they do, and what their environment causes them to do or not do.
 Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
 Typically, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead people who are previously equal to them in status. One extreme of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "your man" (or girl).
 Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary measures, to evaluate the results of work, to distribute responsibilities and to hold employees accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team did and take it for himself.
 After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
 Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
 They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
 The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 The "invisible team" is the team of managers, to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets the norms for each participant.
 Why would organizations go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of self-learning organizations in practice is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively used in all functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can be manifested.
 As a result, the concerted efforts of the organization to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process, which will meet the interests of the client.
 Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
 The data of neuroscience give physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
 The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
 The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
 This provides us with a large amount of data and materials for creating simulation models that help us understand the processes taking place in our consciousness.
 Despite the fact that AI is firmly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important direction of computer science, which considers the behavior and training of machines and the "imprinting" of intelligence.
 AI research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Here are some examples that can be cited: control, planning and creation of a schedule, reaction to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognition of the face, handwriting and voice.
 Such questions are singled out in separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
 Nowadays, AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military sphere, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
 Field trips are very important for any class. Very often teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
 Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art, all while sitting with their class.
 Posting a tour to the virtual space for general viewing is also a great way to refresh the tour in your memory and share your knowledge with future classes.
 For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year the site is updated, but access to older versions is still preserved - they serve as a memory album.
 Blogs can also improve writing skills in students. Although students often start their blog using shoddy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
 Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for improvement of his writing in order to avoid criticism.
 Also, by blogging, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
 The proper use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of other people's work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is a lovely bilingual capital of Canada with a huge number of art galleries and museums that open the past and present of Canada.
 Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the domain of unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
 All this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
 Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
 A surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans in the U.S. than there are citizens in Canada.
 The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is much larger than any other and is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
 Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially it took root on the Comoros and Mayotte.
 The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened a route through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
 In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 For women: All tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 It is also useful to wear a ring (but not too expensive looking).
 Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, followed, touched, and so on.
 Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand on your own (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and the Merinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Caz-Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
 The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed-Dar-el-Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
 Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
 Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole assortment of trinkets, but all this is for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
 In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
 While Goma is a relatively safe place, it is important to check in advance about any trips outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in the North Kivu province.
 This town is also the starting point for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo, and here you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
 You can go to Goma by bodaboda (mototaxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
 Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for the exotic farthest land.
 Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
 In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the danger from the sands of the desert.
 When filming the Henry Louis Gates's PBS series "The African World" one of the most important stops was made here.
 This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arabic, not African.
 Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
 The park area is 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wild animals.
 It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading among South African national parks (SANParks).
 As in all South African national parks, there is a daily conservation fee for the park and for visiting.
 It can also be profitable to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit the national parks of South Africa either selectively or all.
 The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main object of their attention.
 A string of buildings forming the line of Hong Kong's horizon is compared to a glittering column chart, emphasized by the water of Victoria Bay.
 To see the most picturesque places of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and go to the coast of the peninsula of Chu Lung, which is located opposite.
 The majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is closely concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north shore.
 This is the place that British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
 Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, stretching from the shore 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India.
 Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remaining great jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plains.
 Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 sq km, of which about one-third is covered by water or swamp.
 Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and, according to estimates, there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer on its territory.
 Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of the long-distance buses, especially those going to the east and to Jakarta/Bandung, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
 Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most areas are served by small Japanese buses called Coaster, which are comfortable and reliable.
 The minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
 These two towers reach 83 meters in height, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
 The height of the substructure is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
 According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
 The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that is now eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was home to various groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Guayquerí and the Payaaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
 In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was then called the "great province of the East Indies", emerged as a result of the clash between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous population.
 The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
 Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
 The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
 Less major tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year too.
 To find out about polo news and where to buy tickets for matches, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
 British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
 On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; clarify with the owners in advance what method of payment is acceptable.
 The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside of the Islands, so exchange money before leaving the Islands.
 Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, the air temperature above +30 ° C is a common occurrence.
 Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a colder-feeling climate than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
 Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so do not feed or disturb the animals.
 The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves within 100 yards/meters, and all other wildlife within 25 yards/meters!
 No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can attack.
 Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not respect the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
 Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly foods with you, and keep your camp clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
 All ships sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
 During the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful meeting in the town led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Leao Tong.
 There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore (in the area of North Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by trees such as the pohutukawa.
 In the central area of Auckland, where the Waitemata Harbour is located the prestigious suburbs of Mt Eden and St Heliers, the Tamaki Drive beaches are spread.
 These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good choice of shops along the shore, and safe for swimming.
 The most popular local beer is "Number One", it has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
 There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be transported better.
 Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is not difficult to find bottled water.
 Australians do not understand the idea of "flat white". "Little black" is espresso, cappuccino they serve with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea without milk.
 Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
 The reef is visited by a large number of trips throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
 Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
 Cubomedusa is found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, and sometimes outside this period.
 Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
 The crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
 Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at the destination.
 Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
 Travel agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages that include flights and hotel accommodation.
 In addition, they can hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (for example, a visa).
 Any changes or requests must be sent to the tour operator first, and not directly to the hotel.
 At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees sleep on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
 If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
 Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be areas on the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as the passage through the ice leads to a rather scary noise that can disturb the most sensitive people.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
 Casinos usually make every effort to make visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the institution. Windows and clocks are not there, and exits are difficult to find.
 They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and prevent them from leaving.
 Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
 Anyone planning to travel in high-altitude areas or mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
 On the icy and snowy road, the friction is low, and you can not drive the car as on the usual asphalt.
 During a blizzard, enough snow to cause a traffic jam can fall in a very short period of time.
 Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, sleet, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
 On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues throughout the year almost without interruption.
 A safari is probably the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
 The term safari in everyday use means a land trip to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
 Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so even with ordinary equipment you can get a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes wary, and you will see them better through binoculars.
 Walking safari (which is also called "scrambling safari", "hiking safari" or "walking safari") consists of a walk lasting from several hours to several days.
 The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice, having first hosted the Games in 1964.
 If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
 Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
 Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for rent, even if they are not in the room.
 If you don't have an iron or you're not a fan of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if you have one.
 Do not expose the fabric to too high temperatures (which can lead to shrinkage or, in very rare cases, to burns).
 There are different ways to clean water, some of them are more effective against specific threats.
 In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it will take a few minutes.
 Filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubt you should consider buying water in sealed bottles and from a reputable company.
 Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their home countries.
 Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infection.
 Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are not generally considered pests.
 Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain points without taxes and duties.
 Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
 The stretch between Point Marion and Fermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated, hilly, and wooded terrain.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are steep slopes, narrow alleys and sharp turns.
 The speed limits are much lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km / h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than the rest.
 However, oddly enough, mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other parts of the route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German pastry is quite good. In Bavaria it is very abundant and varied and resembles the baking of their southern neighbour, Austria.
 Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are available all year round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
 In German baking often used almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Often popular cakes are perfectly combined with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want small, but filling, baked goods, try what is, depending on the region, called oliebollen or doughnuts with a filling.
 Curry is a dish made of spices and herbs combined with meat or vegetables.
 Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".

 Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 But without qualification, the term most often refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 The Javanese cuisine, today widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a repertoire of unpretentious dishes. The Javanese prefer such flavourings as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
 Stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang from both sides of the saddle.
 They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a risk of foot entrapment.
 If the horse has thrown the rider, but his leg is stuck in the stirrup, the running horse can drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
 First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
 In addition, individual saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety sparks, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
 Coyamó Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and cliffs.
 Up top you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery, and rock climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its huge potential for alpinism.
 Winter mountain sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
 Skiing is the main tourist destination for many skiers (they are sometimes called "skiing bums"), planning a vacation entirely around skiing in a particular place.
 The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
 Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
 Cross-country skiingThis activity is also called backcountry, skituro or hiking on skis.
 This involves, but does not usually include, walking up the summit and then descending down unprepared slopes, as skiing down the fall line requires stiffer skis and boots.
 Imagine that the ski route is a pedestrian route.
 Under good conditions, you can cover several more kilometers than when walking, but such speed on skis you can develop only in very rare cases when you do not have a heavy backpack and there is a groomed ski trail.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states, and in ordinary circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control many times.
 But the Schengen area in this respect functions as a single country.
 Being in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
 Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money and avoid paperwork.
 There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
 This concept has geographical varieties in which the age limit in places like North America may be less than in Europe.
 Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger in age than similar mass-produced goods.
 Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the surrounding culture is also important for many other professions.
 Although this is the tradition, not all representatives of the Saami people engaged in mass breeding of reindeer; they lived fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
 Today, many Saami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Saami region of Lapland.
 Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
 If a country you are planning to visit is under a travel advisory warning, this may affect your travel insurance or your cancellation insurance.
 You may also want to consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their own citizens.
 Here is one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot.
 The information reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
 The views expressed are often superficial, vague and over-simplified compared to the more detailed information that is widely available.
 Adverse weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or human casualties.
 Adverse weather conditions are conditions that occur everywhere around the world, and they come in various types that depend on geography, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, heavy rains and forest fires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
 Regional and seasonal dangerous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice and dust storms.
 Travellers are strongly advised to take into account any risks associated with the harsh weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
 Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
 A search on the Internet for the phrase "survival course in a hostile environment" may yield the address of a local company.
 The course usually covers much more in-depth all the topics covered here, often with practical training.
 The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes playing out situations, a large amount of information on first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
 People planning to have sex change operations abroad should make sure they have valid documents for the return journey.
 The willingness of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.

 Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the scanners and have their privacy and dignity respected.
 Surges — currents created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes a reef or something similar.
 The return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, where rapid currents can form, going to greater depths, due to such underwater topography.
 Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion when trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
 Once you get out of the current, swimming back will not be any harder than usual.
 Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been seen, you may want to wait for rescue.
 Culture shock is the shock of returning to one's own country, which comes earlier than the cultural shock (here a shorter romantic period), lasts longer and can be more severe.
 Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their own culture.
 When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
 When you first went abroad, people were likely to treat you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
 It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
 The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
 The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.
 Usually there is always the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a book with stories.
 The Sphinx acts as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
 Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
 Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which are home to the most bases and in 2020, sixteen were active.
 The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
 Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano is a spectacular natural harbor.
 The land of Ellsworth is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again and form a 360-kilometer mountain system Elsuert, divided by the Minnesota glacier into two parts.
 In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinele ridge, are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson massif, the highest point of which reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson peak.
 In remote places outside the range of mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
 A satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be in the open in line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
 The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communications.
 As a rule, you will be able to obtain additional information about the connection of this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
 An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
 This is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university without jeopardising their education.
 In many cases, attending a course abroad during an academic vacation can indeed increase your chances of getting into higher education institutions at home.
 As a rule, when applying to such educational programs, a fee for training is charged.
 Finland is an excellent place for boating. In the "land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the archipelagos.
 Exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily do without a yacht.
 While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave completely different impressions.
 Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
 A similar situation is observed in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this value is from one to forty).
 Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
 This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, and sleep on the ship.
 If you go to the shore only in the order of excursion on the ship, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
 Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
 Flying on an airplane can be frightening for a person of any age and social status, especially if it is his first flight in life or if he had any traumatic event in the past.
 There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
 Understanding how the plane works and what happens during the flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
 Delivery services are well paid for fast delivery. Often the speed of delivery of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair is very important.
 Some routes have their own aircraft for larger companies, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
 If they were sending anything as air cargo, it could take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
 The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked baggage. The airline regulations do not allow to send baggage without a passenger, so you need to be involved in this.
 The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better, get your company to pay for it).
 However, this is not cheap - according to experience, in a rough approximation, you will pay  four times more than the usual economy class for business and eleven times more for the first class!
 As a rule, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

 Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 While this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will make it much easier to adapt to the city.
 The unfriendly appearance of Parisians will immediately disappear if you show a little elementary politeness.
 Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, fir and pine, and represents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 Thanks to the combination of microclimates, different soils and altitude differences, it is particularly rich in plant communities.

 Here you can meet rare representatives of fauna, for example, the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and hare, as well as many other common species of animals.
 When visiting monasteries, women should be dressed in skirts below the knee and with their shoulders covered.
 Most monasteries will give robes to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is a bright color, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
 Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
 They can also be taken at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may be uncomfortable in these skirts. One size for all men!
 The cuisine of Majorca, as well as the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread and meat (especially pork), with the ubiquitous use of olive oil.

 Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
 Since light pollution was not as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to get to than those built in our time.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 The contemplation of the cherry blossom, called "hanami", has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 This idea came from China, where the favorite flower was the color of the plum.
 In Japan, the first celebrations of the sakura blossoming were arranged by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
 Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't be tempted to take even one specimen.
 Visiting an officially organized garden to collect "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any talk.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, where it is easy to navigate and almost everything can be bought upon arrival.
 But, being in the "deep tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).

 All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying or being washed ashore.
 Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not reach there, making the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience a polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
 This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky will be more or less dark all night.
 Since these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
