 Although one experimental vaccine appears to reduce mortality from the Ebola virus, no drug has so far been proven to treat existing infections.
 A cocktail of antibodies called ZMapp, which was initially expected to play a role in the field, has been found in formal studies to be somewhat less effective at preventing deaths.
 In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a reference, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline against which to compare the other three treatments.
 USA Gymnastics has expressed its support for the USOC in its letter and has accepted the strict requirements of the Olympic family to provide a safe training environment for all athletes.
 We agree with the statement of the USOC that rather than revoke our license, we should continue to work on meaningful change within our organization that will better serve the athletes and the sport.

 This not only confirms the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that has been widely accepted—but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 Scientists say the animal's top feathers are reddish-brown, and its underparts are light or dark purple.
 This discovery also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
 The dinosaurs' feathers did not develop a main shaft, called a rachis, but still had other feather features, such as barbs and barbules, and the researchers infer that the rachis evolved later than these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but for thermoregulation or display. Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
 Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult feathers, not juvenile down.
 Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

 The team is looking for an effect that could be caused by the tidal forces between dark matter in galaxies and dark matter in the Milky Way.
 Just as the Moon exerts a tidal force on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a tidal force on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.
 Scientists can conclude that dark matter behaves the same way as ordinary matter when it comes to the influence of other dark matter.
 The theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in some kind of halo around the galaxy, made up of many small particles.

 Dr. Tony Morrell discovered this widespread drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
 In an interview, he said that the new strain was "very disturbing and worrying because it has a very high mortality rate."
 Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two patients were hospital staff.
 One infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts in a year.
 However, the prevalence of XDR-TB in the overall TB population appears to be low; in South Africa, at any given time, only 6,000 of the 330,000 people with TB are infected with XDR-TB.

 “Compared to the surrounding surfaces, they are cooler during the day and warmer at night.
 “Their hot behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which tend to be fairly steady, but they are similar to the deep underground conditions,” said Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University.
 In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters go into a small booth, put a pre-printed paper with the candidate's name in an envelope.
 After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot register.
 French electoral law sets out a very strict procedure for the election.
 Since 1988, the ballot box has had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that the box is empty when voting begins, and that no one other than the eligible voters deposit ballots in the box.
 Candidates can send representatives to observe every step of the election process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

 The road was temporarily closed and emergency services had to rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adcock was subsequently charged with the murder of her son and appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
 She was detained, awaiting trial and sentencing; but any witnesses' evidence could be negatively affected, because her image had been widely disseminated.
 This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system is different, and the court felt that publishing the pictures could cause potential harm.
 Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: “There does seem to be a danger if journalists publish information such as photographs of suspects.
 The Crown Prosecution Service, the main prosecuting authority, told reporters it would not be making any further comment until the case was brought.
 The document is expected to refer to the border dispute, with Palestine hoping to base it on the pre-1967 war borders.
 Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
 Israel demanded that the military presence in the central part of the valley be extended for 10 years, while the Palestinian National Authority agreed to keep it for only five years.
 Foresters closely monitor the shooters who participate in supplemental trials because the trials are monitored and their effectiveness is evaluated.
 In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the NSW Deer Stalkers Association, the Deer Stalkers Association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
 Mick O’flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Protection and Heritage Management, said: “The four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
 Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in by a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
 This is the fifth time that Martelly has been named to the CEP in four years.
 Last month, the presidential council recommended the resignation of the former CEP, part of a push to move the country toward new elections.
 The commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
 Since 2011, these protests have sometimes escalated into violent incidents, as a result of some elections not being held on time.
 About 60 iPods reportedly malfunctioned, overheated and caused six fires, injuring four people.
 Japan's Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry (METI) said it had noted 27 accidents related to the equipment.
 Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, although the company said the incidents were "not serious".
 The Economic Development Agency responded that Apple's delay in issuing the report was "very regrettable".
 The earthquake occurred at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT) on Friday.
 The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said there were no reported damage to property.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said it had not detected any tsunami signs.
 A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila and took the Hong Kong passengers hostage.
 Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
 Several hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages were confirmed dead.
 Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
 The two photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed to go to the toilet, and Mendoza was killed.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps, beginning a career as a doctor.
 He trained as a midwife and worked at the Auckland National Women's Hospital from 1959.
 While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
 His research showed that the application of hormones could accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
 The government investigators found two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
 Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
 Tommy Mottola said, “Lorna was the first Queen, my first manager. Lorna passed away on the night of the full moon. It was a night like her. She was a strong woman.”
 Dustin Runnels (aka Goldust) commented, “Luna is as hard to figure out as I am… She might be even harder to figure out… I love her and I miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
 A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election found that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 per cent since 2008.
 Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who was in the running for the 2010 federal election, said she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
 34% of respondents agreed that the Queen of England, Elizabeth II, should be the last monarch of Australia.
 The poll showed a two-way split, with 29% of respondents saying Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% saying it should never become a republic.
 The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and Commonwealth Games relay events, but his health has been in question due to his complaints.
 He was unable to take painkillers because of the competition rules.
 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
 In early February, several people validated the discovery using different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
 Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
 Scientists want to know how planets form, especially Earth.
 The 53-year-old Cuomo has been governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
 He called the rumors “political nonsense and stupidity.”
 He is expected to run for president in 2016.
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says NextGen will allow planes to fly more direct routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
 It uses satellite technology, rather than the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
 There are no additional transport options, no surface trains to Wembley, no car parks and no interchange facilities.
 Fearing a lack of transport, the match could have been played behind closed doors without the support of the fans.
 On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science said a new bird species had formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
 Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that, because of the local Darwin's finches and the introduced Gouldian finches, the new species has only evolved for two generations, despite the belief that the process would take longer.
 Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
 It can be drawn into fine threads, used for wrapping and weaving. It can also be pounded or rolled into a sheet.
 It can be made very thin, sticking to other metals, and because it is so thin it can sometimes be used to decorate the drawings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
 This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make a pH indicator.
 The color of the sauce will change depending on the acidity of the chemicals.
 pH is a measure of the number of hydrogen ions in a chemical.
 Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
 Stir the two powders together, then use a clean, wet hand to form a ball.
 The water on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a sort of shell that feels very interesting.
 Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every household, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
 The remains of sewage systems have been found in houses on the Greek island of Crete and in the city of Santorini.
 Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were always part of public baths, which were mixed-gender.
 You use satellites to call people who are thousands of miles away.
 The satellite in space receives the call and almost immediately reflects it back.
 Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
 To get a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed.
 The wheel has changed the world in unimaginable ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is that it has made our transportation more convenient.
 Without it, we would not have trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
 Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope.
 In the end, many small carnivores (including domestic cats) feed on a much larger variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
 Their success is based on the concept of a hierarchy, with each cat being responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
 Lions are the most social of the cat family, living in large groups called prides.
 Lion prides consist of one to three adult males that are related, and up to thirty females and cubs.
 As sisters and daughters in a large family, the females are usually close to each other.
 The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf or dog packs, and these animals behave in ways that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats).
 Tigers are all-round athletes, they can climb (although not very well), swim, jump and pull with a force five times that of a human strongman.
 Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only members of the cat family that roar.
 The roar of a tiger is not as deep as that of a lion, but more like a growl.
 Cheetahs like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The prey of cheetahs is almost always much smaller than the cheetah itself.
 Scientists believe that the jaguar tracks and hunts its prey by smelling and sniffing out the animal's trail on the ground.
 They have excellent night vision and can see very well in the dark. They are also very stealthy. The leopard's hunting style is to blend in with the surroundings and then pounce on its prey.
 When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their original main population (for example, by crossing a mountain range or river, or by reaching a new island where they cannot easily return) they often find that their environment is different.
 This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, not the ones they needed before.
 The original population has not changed at all, and it still needs to adapt to the environment as before.
 Over time, new populations began to adapt to their new environment, and they began to look more and more different from the other populations.
 After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
 We call this process “speciation,” or the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary outcome of evolution, and it is a crucial part of the process.
 Plants can make oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
 Plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
 We build houses with plants. We make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
 The Dragon was the top predator of that era, and it feared nothing but its own kind.
 Its lower jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and its upper jaw has a row of teeth as well. This means that anything that comes in contact with it has no chance of escaping.
 Its tongue is probably forked, but we are not sure. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other plesiosaurs, and even humans.
 It will attack anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex is no match for it.
 Although most of the foods the Romans ate are familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called the dormouse.
 Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich like to have a banquet together, lying on the side to eat.
 Foods that were introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia several centuries later could not have been part of the Roman diet.
 For example, they have no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, and cocoa, and no Roman ever ate chicken.
 The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, as if the god were living in the temple.
 People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would satisfy the gods through rituals and festivals.
 Each temple has an open courtyard, as well as a inner sanctuary that is only accessible to priests.
 Some special towers are pyramid-shaped, and are called pyramid-shaped temples.
 The top of the tower is a special place for God.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not so important.
 The Hebrew family spends most of its time outdoors.
 Women cook in the courtyard; shops are open stalls on the street. They build houses with stones.
 Canaan had no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
 Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse Saga of Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for murder, he sailed west and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
 But whether or not he found them, the Eskimos were already there.
 Although they are all part of the Scandinavian region, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have many differences in their people, kings, customs and history.
 If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
 However, this is not the case. Although the back of the document has some writing on it, it is not a map.
 The back of the Declaration of Independence reads “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776” in a reversed font.
 Although no one knows who the author was, this large parchment document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been rolled up and stored when it was freshly written.
 So it is likely that the symbol was added as a label.
 The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
 It was ruled by the Vichy French, who in 1940 made a peace agreement with the Germans and cooperated with them instead of resisting the invaders.
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an operation known as "Operation Dynamo."
 In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
 Civilization is a single culture shared by a community of people who live together and work together (society).
 The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "citizen") and "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "state"), which in some ways defines the scale of society.
 The city-state is the ancestor of the nation. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the footprints of culture remain, and culture can be fairly distributed.
 Minority cultures often disappear without a trace, and are not considered to be civilized.
 During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (Congress was its only component) under the Articles of Confederation.
 Congress has no power to tax, and because there is no national executive or judiciary, Congress can only rely on the state governments to enforce all laws, which often do not cooperate.
 It also has no power to override state tax and tariff laws.
 These amendments must be ratified by all states, and the states are so hostile to the central government that their state representatives often fail to show up.
 The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, winning the World Cup in 2006.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and Formula One racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the north, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
 Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
 Because Japan is a group of islands, it is often called an "archipelago" from a geological point of view.
 Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island “Ilha Formosa,” meaning beautiful island.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, and began to change the aboriginal people's food production methods and hired Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared Taiwan a province.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
 The ancient city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
 To better acquaint visitors with the original appearance of the ensemble, most of the buildings on the edge of the ensemble have been reconstructed.
 By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
 It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is used in digital camera image sensors.
 The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is a bit confusing.
 Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
 Many common formats (for example, the APS format series) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
 The often-abused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamic images that also help keep the image orderly.
 It states that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
 During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
 Although the languages and customs of the European countries differ, Christianity has been uniting them for more than a thousand years.
 From the king to the commoner, it permeates the power of the ten directions and influences every person.
 One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church’s money fund is set up to do just that.
 The centralized power of the church in Rome had existed for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money had led many to question whether they were following the one true faith.
 Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
 They cut off the life-saving supply of military and civilian goods. The strategy proved effective, even though the blockade violated international law, which had been widely accepted under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
 Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire area, even neutral ships.
 Because the response to this strategy has been limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
 In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
 After witnessing the atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, accepting a job with the Edison Electric Company in New York City.
 He arrived in the United States with four cents, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former employer, to Thomas Edison.
 The different periods of China's history are distinctive; each period or dynasty that ruled China was a distinctive dynasty.
 Similarly, the period of dynastic change was a time of instability for small states, most notably the 60-year Three Kingdoms period, which was sandwiched between the Han and Jin dynasties.
 During these turbulent times, various warlords fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for control of the luxurious palaces of Xi'an.
 There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the shift from autocratic to republican forms of government, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
 In addition, after the revolution, the post was open to all men, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to rise to the top.
 The same goes for the military, where ranks are no longer based on seniority but on merit.
 The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave on Mount Nur (Light) called Hira, where he would meditate.
 The cave itself, not only withstood the test of time and remained intact, but also gave Muhammad's spiritual intent a very vivid image.
 The cave is located on the top of a mountain in northern Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
 In fact, even if you know it's there, it's not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely cut off from the world.
 Except for the clear blue sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing can be seen. In the cave, almost nothing can be seen or heard from the outside.
 The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
 The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids that pay tribute to the deceased pharaoh.
 The Giza plateau in Egypt (the site of the “Great Pyramids”) includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller pyramids, several temples, and the Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Khufu's wife and family members.
 The “up bow” symbol looks like the letter V, and the “down bow” symbol looks like a nail or a square with a missing bottom.
 The upward arrow indicates that the bow is pulled from the top, and the downward arrow indicates that the bow is pulled from the bottom.
 The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow makes a stronger, more determined sound.
 Please feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the notes you make are musical in nature, so they should generally be respected.
 On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, his Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), as well as the King's sister, the Duchess of Parma, were escorted by a mob of market women from Versailles to Paris.
 They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, and a crowd surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
 The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
 In front of the terrified queen, a rioter brandished the head of a royal guard who had been killed at the Tuileries.
 The war expenditures of the U.S. imperialists in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
 Of course, the high profits gained by the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people are the basic gains of US imperialism.
 To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the creation of the Knights Templar.
 The period in which the events took place is usually called the high Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
 The period before the high point of the Middle Ages is called the Early Middle Ages, and the period after the high point is called the Late Middle Ages, with the Late Middle Ages generally considered to end around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological inevitability, and a strict definition—that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
 Most explanations of technological determinism include both of these general ideas: that the development of technology is largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology has an inherent “influence” on society that is independent of social conditions.
 For example, one might say that cars will necessarily promote road development.
 However, building a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so a new production method was developed to reduce the cost of cars.
 The high number of cars in circulation also leads to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which in turn will drive the development of new medical technologies for the treatment of injuries.
 Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism color. This comes from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
 In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and with time, geographically related customs and cultures emerged, which were much more in tune with the place in society than any arbitrary imposed law.
 Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
 Its reputation as a center of luxury goods began around the year 400 and lasted until around the year 1100.
 Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders brought back goods such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those available in the Byzantine market.
 It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
 Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
 Initially, the dress was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
 However, because of the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
 As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest advances was the introduction of buttons after the Crusades.
 Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out on a small scale to provide food for the needs of subsistence farmers and their families.
 Permaculture is a simple and often organic system that uses local seeds stored in the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
 Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
 The subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel that they are being overlooked by the mainstream, and the subculture fosters a sense of belonging among them.
 Given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members, subcultures may be distinct.
 The qualities that make a culture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-related, geographic, or a combination of factors.
 Members of subcultures often use unique styles of dress, behavior, and slang to symbolize their membership.
 One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the case of a few unfortunate children who, because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults.
 Such children are called "feral children", meaning wild children. Some feral children are kept in confinement by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child is abandoned because the parents refuse to accept the child has serious mental or physical disabilities.
 Wild children may have suffered severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
 Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
 A wolf child raised entirely by non-human animals will behave (within the limits of its physical condition) very much like that animal, for example showing fear or indifference towards humans.
 While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding takes it a step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a means to help people who are just learning to use a new computer program or start a new project.
 Scaffolding can be done online or offline, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, just like the little helper in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual support is embedded in the software to question, prompt and explain those procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
 Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
 No child should grow up in an environment without nurturing, without care, without education, but that is what happened.
 We believe the foster system is a safe place for these children.
 Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
 Foster care systems should provide all the necessities that the child's original family lacks.
 The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
 The Internet's distinctive characteristics add an extra dimension to its uses and fulfillment.
 For example, “learning” and “socializing” are considered to be important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
 In their study of the audience response to the site, Eyre and McDowell (1998) also identified “personal involvement” and “continuing relationship” as new motivational factors.
 The use of video has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
 Specifically, it is said that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly reading their micro-expression.
 Oliver Sacks, in his essay “The President’s Speech,” notes that people with brain damage who cannot understand language can still tell whether a speaker is being sincere.
 He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a common trait among animals, such as dogs.
 Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic variation comes in two forms: overt and covert.
 Mutations add new genetic variation, while selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
 Because of the separation and recombination, variation is shuttled back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
 In the tropics, mammals have a digestive system similar to that of humans, and the available plant resources are not sufficient to meet the amino acid requirements of mammals.
 In addition, if this is not done, there will be serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and eventually death.
 The easiest plant-based resources to obtain would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us mammals to digest unless they are cooked.
 In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
 In light of the above, if our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in the same way as the black apes of today’s tropical grasslands, we should not be surprised.
 Sleep disruption is defined as a process in which a person is awakened intentionally during normal sleep and falls asleep again within a short time (10-60 minutes).
 This is easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
 If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while you're asleep, you can put the clock on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Other biologically-based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known to have a diuretic effect) before bedtime, and forcing oneself to urinate.
 The degree of calmness in a person's mind is the opposite of the degree of tension in his body and mind.
 The less pressure, the more vitality. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
 Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only thing that prevents us from doing so is our own tension and negative emotions.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and the many techniques of yoga from India.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the methods of kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
 In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tantric yoga. Through the transformation of different deities, the purification of energy channels, and the activation of chakras, one can reach a state of enlightenment.
 Germany was the common enemy of all the nations in World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, however, the conflict in terms of systems, procedures and cultures resumed.
 Two years after the war ended， former allies became enemies， and the Cold War began.
 The war lasted 40 years, with the proxy armies fighting on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
 By 17 September 1939, the Polish front had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
 However, these plans were almost immediately abandoned, and after the invasion of eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops crossed the border and occupied positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
 To date, shipping has been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
 Traditionally, the Navy's mission is to ensure the nation's ability to transport people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to do the same.
 One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to cross the Atlantic to help the British.
 Meanwhile, the German Navy, with its U-boat fleet, attempted to intercept the convoy.
 If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
 Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
 Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, wool, and hides.
 The family sheep are usually herded in groups on the mountains or other pastures, and are usually looked after by shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds.
 Britain had built truck lanes as early as the 16th century.
 Although the mara railroad cars were only made of parallel boards, at that time, for the slightly bumpy road, these cars could make the horses run faster and pull more.
 Early on, railroad ties were used to secure the rails, but it was soon realized that if iron plates were placed on the rails, the rails would be more stable and effective.
 This became the general practice, but the iron plates made the wooden wheels of the chariots wear out more quickly.
 Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was built.
 The first known mode of transportation was walking. 200,000 years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, humans began to walk upright.
 Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
 The bipedalism of humans is thought to have evolved around 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
 We can start living greener, join the green movement, and even become green activists, to reduce the disaster to some extent.
 In many cases this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want a permanent solution, we should look for the root of the problem and eliminate it completely.
 It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to human scientific and technological advances, and the overpopulation and luxurious lifestyle of human beings have made the problem more serious.
 The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and sent to John Dunlap's printing shop across the street to be printed.
 They printed 150 to 200 copies overnight, the now-famous Dunlap broadsides.
 On July 8, John Nixon read the document aloud for the first time in the Independence Hall courtyard.
 One of these, dated 6 July, was sent to George Washington, who read it to his army in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
 The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving versions of the document, as the handwritten original has not survived.
 Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continued to live until today, which is what we call “birds”.
 Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But birds still have many places similar to dinosaurs.
 They have scales on their feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
 Today, almost all computers in use are based on the processing of binary code.
 Binary numbers can only take on one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
 Internal poisoning may not immediately manifest itself, and symptoms such as vomiting are common, so it cannot be immediately diagnosed.
 The most powerful indication of ingestion of a poison is a container that has been opened on the scene and contains a drug or household chemical.
 Check the label on the drug for specific first aid instructions.
 Entomologists use the term “bug” to formally refer to this class of insects.
 The term comes from the familiarity of the human race with the botfly, a parasitic insect that is well adapted to infest humans.
 Bedbugs and cockroaches are both nesting insects, adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
 In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that has become the leading neurological disorder of middle age.
 Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves).
 Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
 A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
 These couples may have a plan to adopt children.
 In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
 The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works, and in fact this method can guide most scientific research.
 An experiment is a test to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but experiments are not the only way to conduct scientific research; asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
 Naturalists and philosophers were interested in the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
 Aristotle's views on all scientific fields, including psychology, were accepted.
 With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
 Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms that researchers observed were largely dependent on the endogenous circadian rhythms and their presence.
 Periodic rhythms are not just a simple response to external periodic signals. Such rhythms are recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 The biological clock is a self-maintaining oscillator that keeps a period of time, even when there is no external cue.
 The experiments of Hershey and Chase were the first to show that DNA was the primary carrier of genetic information.
 Hersey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
 They did two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the bacteria's DNA, and one using radioactive sulfur to label the bacteria's proteins.
 Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the cell is a reproductive cell.
 Only the mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to the child, while the mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
 Nature tourism attracts those interested in natural areas, who come to view natural scenery, including wildlife.
 Activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours and ecosystem studies.
 For example, visiting, filming and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to work, passing the places where the people they pass are working.
 In this dynamic traffic flow, everyone is connected to and supports the car-based transportation system in some way.
 Now, science shows that this massive carbon economy can no longer sustain the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
 Everyone is a member of society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
 In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses of similar magnitude.
 Why do transport systems cause so many complaints? Why do they break down every day? Is it because transport engineers are incompetent, or is there a more fundamental reason?
 Traffic flow studies are concerned with the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
 Unfortunately, research on traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
 Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to be within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, the traffic flow tends to have a certain reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed in mathematical terms.
 To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the three main characteristics: (1) volume, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
 Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly made them easier to escape from predators and more effective in finding food and mates.
 Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
 This gives them more small surface area to hide from predators.
 Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
 Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
 Some people think he is right, but many others disagree; they think the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the Sun, too (and even other stars).
 This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
 The Amazon is the second longest river in the world, and it has more than eight times the volume of the next largest river.
 The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, with some sections as wide as 6 miles.
 The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all riverine discharge to the oceans.
 The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
 Although the construction of stone pyramids continued into the Late Period, the grand scale and sophisticated construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
 The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
 The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the smallest in terms of population.
 The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, statutes and official communications.
 Italian is also the language most commonly used by people working in the country, while Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
 People have known about the basic chemical elements gold, silver, copper, etc. since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature in their natural forms and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
 The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire.
 This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new matter, making up the things we see.
 Alloys are generally made of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
 Calcium, potassium, and the like are metals, and silver and gold are metals, of course.
 There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
 Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain millions of billions of atoms.
 So when the pencil was invented, it became a favorite of many people.
 Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status has been steadily declining and its use has been steadily decreasing.
 People now write on computer screens, and never touch pen and paper.
 We can only guess what the future holds for the keyboard as new products emerge.
 The principle of the fission bomb is as follows: It takes energy to bring a nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
 It's a bit like pushing a heavy little trolley up a hill, and then splitting the nucleus of the atom again, and releasing some energy.
 Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning that they are likely to split under little or no stimulation.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The crust is about 70 kilometers thick near the surface and about 100 kilometers thick at the far side.
 The dark side is thinner than the light side, and the highlands are thicker.
 Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
 The core of the content theory of motivation is to find factors that are recognized or generate interest.
 These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain degree into adulthood, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
 These theories study why some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 Generally, when managers start leading former colleagues, there are two behaviors that can occur. One is that they try to maintain a “close relationship” with the team members.
 This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and has difficulty enforcing discipline, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
 In another extreme case, this person becomes a totally different individual, feeling that he/she must change everything the team does and take credit for the results.
 After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leader and the other members of the team.
 Virtual teams need to maintain the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
 Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their corresponding offline team.
 They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams may schedule meetings across different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
 The very existence of a “hidden team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
 Why would an organization spend so much time building a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional units of an organization, creativity and innovation will occur.
 Therefore, an organization in the process of overcoming obstacles together often brings new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
 Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create an innovation culture, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
 Angels (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
 The relationship between brain pathology and behavior can support researchers in their studies.
 We have known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, disease and tumors can affect people's behavior and cause certain cognitive changes.
 New technologies have enabled us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain in ways that were never possible before.
 This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build a virtual model that helps us understand the brain's processes.
 Artificial intelligence has a strong science-fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning and intelligence of machines.
 Artificial intelligence (AI) research is concerned with building machines that perform tasks that require intelligence.
 Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and customer issues, handwriting recognition, voice and facial features.
 All of these became independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to problems in real life.
 Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and some home computers and video game software applications have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
 Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Teachers are usually happy to take students to places that are not accessible by public transport.
 Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or view beautiful artwork in the classroom.
 Sharing the field trip virtually is also a good way to review the trip and share the experience with the next class.
 For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their state capitals trip. The website is redesigned each year, but the old versions are kept online as scrapbooks.
 Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often start out using grammar and spelling incorrectly when they begin blogging， the presence of readers often changes this.
 Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers begin to work hard to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
 Blogging also “forces students to be more observant of the world around them.” To meet the audience’s interest, students are motivated to become smarter and more interesting.
 Blogging is a tool that can foster collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
 "Blogging can help students become better at analysis and reasoning; by actively responding to web materials, students can find their own position in the context of others' articles and can express their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
 Ottawa is Canada's capital city, a vibrant and bilingual city with a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
 Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north is the Muskoka River and the unspoiled natural beauty on the other side of the river.
 All of these things make Ontario the quintessential image of Canada that foreigners have in their minds.
 Further north, the vast expanses are sparsely populated, and some places are deserted.
 A stunning population comparison: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
 The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is the largest island in the world, and for wildlife it is a continent unto itself.
 The smaller islands are mostly independent or French territories, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
 The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and this religion is prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
 European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorers such as Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route to India.
 It is bordered by the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
 Female: It is recommended that all female visitors, regardless of their actual marital status, should state that they are married.
 Wearing a ring can help, too (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
 Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment; and that being followed, grabbed, etc. is not uncommon.
 When you refuse a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (regardless of cultural differences, be firm and say no!).
 The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenid.
 The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casa Branca, until they abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
 The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
 Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
 Shops selling Moroccan traditional goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and various trinkets are common in the Medina, but these are aimed at tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge of the Congo, near Rwanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the town, especially the town centre.
 While Goma is relatively safe, travel to any destination outside Goma should be researched in advance to determine whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has abated.
 The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for the cheapest gorilla tracking in Africa.
 You can tour Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxis). The normal (local) price for short trips is 500 Congolese francs.
 Also because of its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has come to be used to refer to a distant foreign land.
 Today, although Timbuktu is a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
 In 1990, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in Danger.
 This was a key stop on Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special, African American Lives.
 The city contrasts with the rest of the country, as it is more Arabic than African.
 Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north.
 The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones to support different wildlife.
 It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
 Like all South African national parks, the park charges an entrance fee and a conservation fee every day.
 A Wild Card also has many advantages. With this card, you can enter some of South Africa's parks or all of the national parks.
 Hong Kong Island is the name card of Hong Kong, and also the focus of many tourists.
 The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a flashing graphic on the water of Victoria Harbour.
 To get the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and head to the beaches on the other side of the harbour.
 Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
 This is where the British colonists occupied the land, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good place to start.
 The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
 The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
 But these forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also contain the remains of some of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
 Sønderborg Municipality covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is water/marsh area.
 Since 1966, Sondeur has been a wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sambar deer living in the area.
 There are buses running from the city centre bus station (across the river) all day, but most of the buses, especially those to the east and to Jajarkot/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
 Given the frequent fullness of the interval buses, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
 Most areas are served by comfortable, sturdy Japanese minibuses called Coaster buses.
 To get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), a shared taxi is a convenient and comfortable way to go.
 The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
 The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and there are two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
 The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not until March 2017 that it was put into operation.
 The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
 The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group in the eastern part of Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with some agricultural activities.
 The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
 Paraguay in the 16th century was called the “Great Indian Province” and was the result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups of the region.
 The Spanish began a three-century-long period of colonization.
 Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has sought to preserve many of the city's native characteristics and features.
 Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
 The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
 On other days of the year, smaller championships and competitions are also held here.
 For news of the tournament and how to buy tickets for the horse racing, please see the Argentine Horse Racing Association website.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equal in value to the British pound.
 Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
 The pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
 On the Outer Islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency is accepted; please check with the owner in advance to confirm the method of payment accepted.
 It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you should exchange it before you leave.
 Montevideo is located south of the Equator， so in the northern hemisphere， it is summer in the winter， and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in summer months, temperatures often exceed 30 °C.
 Winters may feel colder than they actually are: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 There is no specific “rainy season” and “dry season” here: the annual rainfall is more or less the same.
 Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, they are still wild animals and we should not feed or disturb them.
 Park officials say that bears and wolves should be kept at least 100 yards away, while all other wildlife should be kept at least 25 yards away.
 No matter how gentle they look, bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking humans.
 Each year, dozens of visitors are injured by failing to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
 In addition, bears and other wildlife are attracted by odors, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the campground clean.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The Gulf had been the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the Gulf.
 Except for one British cruiser, all the ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
 In the struggle for independence organized by the Māori sportsman, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
 Auckland straddles two harbours, so there are many beaches in the city. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
 The North Shore beaches (within the North Shore City) run along the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 It's almost all sand, so swimming is safe, and there's plenty of shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
 Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour, just off Mission Bay and the upmarket suburb of St Heliers in central Auckland.
 These beaches are sometimes crowded with holidaymakers, with a variety of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
 The main local beer is “Number One” beer. It is not complex, but it is very drinkable and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta”.
 You can buy a lot of French wine here, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better suited to long-distance transport.
 Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still worried, bottled water is readily available.
 The concept of “latte” coffee is still relatively new to Australians. Small cups of black coffee are “espresso”, cappuccino is a lot of foam (not froth) on top of coffee, and tea is not served with milk.
 Hot chocolate is standard in Belgium. Fruit juices are expensive, but of good quality.
 There are many people who visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year and there are very few incidents of injury on the Great Barrier Reef as a result of any of the above activities.
 Despite this, you should still listen to the advice of the relevant authorities, follow all the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
 Box jellyfish appear on the beaches and estuaries around 1770 town from October to April each year, and occasionally at other times.
 Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
 The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the mouths of rivers in the north of Rockhampton.
 Advance booking can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
 While a travel agency may be able to book you a camping or other form of accommodation, they will usually work with a specific hotel.
 Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even airfare and hotel accommodations.
 If you need time to consider the price or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can reserve the booking for you.
 If any changes are required or any requests are made, they should be made through the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
 At some festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this to be an important part of the festival experience.
 If you want to get close to the action, you'll have to get there early and stake out a good spot near the stage.
 Remember, although the main stage music may have finished, the rest of the festival may still be playing music until the early hours of the morning.
 Some music festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
 If you cross the North Sea in winter, you have to check the position of the cabin, because sailing on the ice will bring very terrible noise to the most affected people.
 St. Petersburg cruises include an in-city tour. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please see Terms and Conditions for details).
 Casinos generally try to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos often have no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
 They typically provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and at the casino.
 Some venues provide free alcoholic drinks. However, drinking alcohol can impair your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
 Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high latitudes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
 On snow-covered roads, the friction is very low, so you can't drive as fast as on a clean asphalt road.
 In a blizzard, a short amount of snowfall can trap you.
 Snow, sleet, water droplets or ice on the windshield can also obstruct your vision.
 On the other hand, snow and ice are common in many countries, and transportation is almost never interrupted.
 Hunting safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa, and are a highlight of many tourist itineraries.
 The word “safari” is commonly used to refer to a land-based trip to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
 Some animals (such as elephants and moose) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for better viewing.
 Lions, leopards and cheetahs are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
 Hiking (also called bushwalking, backpacking, or trekking) is walking, usually for recreation and exercise, but also for sport and survival.
 The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
 Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, the first time was in 1964.
 If you booked a 2020 flight and accommodation before the announcement, you may be in a tricky situation.
 Policies vary, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellations due to the coronavirus have not been extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled to be held.
 Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with the average price around 7,000 yen.
 Wringing wet clothes can help them dry. Even if you don't have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer laundry services.
 If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer (if you have one).
 Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, can burn the clothes).
 There are many ways to purify water, and some are more effective for specific contaminants.
 In some areas, one minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
 The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
 Travellers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their home country.
 Pests can damage food, cause irritation, and in more severe cases, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread disease.
 Infectious diseases themselves, or those dangerous animals that can kill humans through violence, are not usually considered pests.
 Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy duty-free goods in a specific location.
 Travellers to countries/regions with high taxes on alcohol, tobacco and other products can sometimes save a lot of money by buying these products in these places.
 The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, where the road frequently travels through remote, isolated areas.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, you had better keep your wits about you: there are steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp bends everywhere.
 The posted speed limit is significantly lower than on the preceding and succeeding stretches of road, and strict adherence to the speed limit is more important than on other stretches.
 Strangely enough, though, the cell phone service here is much better than on many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania prairie.
 Germany has some great pastries, but Bavaria is even more diverse, similar to its southern neighbour Austria.
 Fruit pastries are very common, and apples can be used all year round to make pastries, while cherries and apricots are also available in the summer.
 Many German baked goods also feature almonds, pine nuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with strong coffee.
 If you want something a little more flavorful, try a fruit jam filled pastry, which is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
 Curry is a dish made with spices and herbs and meat or vegetables.
 Curry dishes can be either “dry” or “wet”, depending on how much water is used.
 In northern India and inland Pakistan, curd is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
 Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of local cuisines.
 But without further ado, this word is often used to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 Now, the island is full of Javanese cuisine, with many simple dishes, and the main flavors that the Javanese like are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially from the Javanese coconut) and various spices.
 The stirrups are attached to the sides of the saddle and are used to support the rider's feet.
 They provide better stability for the rider, but also have safety risks, as the rider's feet can get stuck.
 If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag the rider along as it runs. To minimise the risk of this happening, a few precautions can be taken.
 First of all，most horseback riders wear spurs，and the shoes are very smooth and narrow.
 Secondly, some saddles – particularly English saddles – have safety catches, which, if the rider falls off backwards, will release the girth from the saddle.
 Chile's premier mountaineering destination, the Cochamó Valley, has been called South America's Yosemite, with its array of granite walls and cliffs.
 From the peaks, the view is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the sheer cliffs that serve as a climbing wall.
 Alpine skiing includes both downhill and cross-country skiing, and is a very popular sport in which a ski or snowboard is attached to your feet and you slide down snow-covered terrain.
 Skiing is the main tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "ski bums", who plan to spend the entire holiday at a single location.
 The idea of skiing has been around for a long time – cave paintings of skiers date back to 5,000 BC!
 As a sport, downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was established in Australia by Norwegians.
 Skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
 This activity is related to Alpine skiing or mountaineering, but is not usually done on the same terrain and requires harder skis and boots.
 Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
 In good conditions, you can walk further than you can run—but only in a few cases will you be able to match the speed of cross-country skiing on a flat track with a heavy pack on your back.
 Europe is a continent of relatively small size but with many independent countries, and traveling across multiple countries usually means having to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
 However, in this respect, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
 As long as you are staying in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without going through the passport checkpoint again.
 Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money and hassle.
 There is no uniform definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define an antique as anything over 100 years old.
 The definition varies geographically, and the age limit may be shorter in North America than in Europe.
 Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although they are much younger than mass-produced counterparts.
 Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the industry is important to many who make their living in other ways.
 However, even if we take the traditional view, not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, and they lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and often kept reindeer as draft animals.
 Nowadays, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income in the Sami area.
 Although the word “Gypsy” is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is generally considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
 If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different treatment than Europeans or Arabs.
 Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the situation on the ground.
 The advice given here is often more general, less detailed and less specific than that given elsewhere.
 Adverse weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather condition that causes disruption, severe social disruption or loss of life.
 Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. Severe weather comes in many different types, depending on geography, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
 Hurricanes, hailstorms, excessive rainfall, wildfires, and thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
 Extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
 Travellers are strongly advised to pay attention to the severe weather risks in their destination, which may affect their travel plans.
 Anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
 Search the Internet for “survival training” and you may find the address of a local company that offers training.
 This course will typically cover all the topics discussed here, and will often be taught in a hands-on manner.
 The training usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
 Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but those about survival in the battlefield are rare.
 Travelers who plan to have gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid documents when they return.
 As for whether governments are willing to issue passports without a gender (X) designation, or to change documents to match a desired name and gender, the answer is mixed.
 The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign governments also varies widely.
 In the post-September 11 era, security checkpoints have become more intrusive.
 Transgender people who have not yet had surgery have to reveal their privacy when they go through the scanner, and cannot guarantee their dignity.
 Offshore drift is the rapid return of sea waves to the sea from a beach, usually occurring at a reef or similar feature.
 The underwater topography causes the currents to concentrate in a few deep areas, where they can form strong currents flowing towards the deep water.
 Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current, which is unlikely to succeed.
 After escaping the turbulent water, it was not so difficult to get back.
 Try to swim to a place where you won't get stuck again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted).
 The shock of returning home is faster, stronger, and more lasting than the cultural shock.
 For travelers who are easily adaptable to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to re-adapt to their own culture.
 After living abroad for a while, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and have dropped some of your home culture.
 When you first arrive in a country, people may be very patient and understanding, because they know that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
 People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on the way back.
 For children, the Sound and Light Show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts you can see them silently standing there.
 You can hear the voices of tourists and street vendors in the background, as if they were telling a moving story.
 The backdrop is a lion-faced man, who is also the narrator of the long story.
 The scene is displayed on the pyramid, with different pyramids being lit up.
 The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and the islands have the most bases of any archipelago, with sixteen bases in use in 2020.
 The islands are located 120 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
 Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still active volcano is submerged by the sea, providing a spectacular natural harbour.
 Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The peninsula's mountains were folded into the highlands, and then re-formed into the 360-kilometre-long Ellsworth Mountains, which were bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
 In the north, or rather the Sentinel Range, the highest mountains of Antarctica are found, the highest being Mount Vinson, 4,892 metres.
 In remote areas where cell phone coverage is poor, a satellite phone may be your only option.
 Satellite phones generally cannot replace mobile phones because they can only be used outdoors when the satellite signal is strong.
 The service is often used for shipping, including yachts, and for adventures with long-distance data and voice needs.
 Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with detailed information about connecting to this service.
 For those planning how to spend their gap year, study abroad is becoming an increasingly popular option.
 This is particularly popular among high school graduates who can take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
 In many cases, attending a gap year program abroad can substantially improve your chances of getting into a university back home.
 Typically, these educational programs require a fee.
 Finland is a sailing paradise, with the nickname “the thousand lakes country”, and thousands of islands in its lakes and archipelago.
 On the islands and lakes，boats are not necessary.
 The size of the archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, but even smaller boats and even kayaks can bring a different experience.
 Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
 Norway, Sweden and New Zealand also have similar situations, but in other respects they are unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
 Most typical Baltic cruises will spend a longer time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 This means you can have several full days to explore this historic city, then sleep on the boat at night.
 If you are only going to visit the island by boat, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
 Some brochures advertise Berlin as a highlight of the cruise, but as can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and the cruise price does not include the cost of visiting the city.
 For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially if they have never flown before or have had a bad experience.
 This is not a bad thing: it is not much different from the fear and disgust that many people feel about other things.
 For some people, understanding how airplanes work and how they fly can help them overcome their fear of the unknown or uncontrollable.
 Courier companies can earn high wages for fast delivery of goods. Time is often of the essence for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
 On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it's a problem.
 If they use air transport, it can take several days to unload and clear goods on some routes.
 The fastest way is to have it shipped as baggage. According to the airline's regulations, it is forbidden to carry unaccompanied baggage, and you will be needed at the scene.
 The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money to enjoy the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
 However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the price of a business class ticket could be 4 times that of an economy class ticket, and the price of a first class ticket could be 11 times that of an economy class ticket!
 Generally speaking, if you fly from A to B, there is no need to look for discounted business class or first class tickets.
 Airlines are well aware that some core customers are willing to pay a premium for fast, comfortable travel, and they charge accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
 Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
 In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of the Transnistrian Moldavian Republic, a self-proclaimed state in eastern Moldova with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any United Nations member state.
 Although the political talks failed, the economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were re-established.
 The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodoxy.
 Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of about 3.7 million, and it is Turkey's second largest port, after Istanbul, and a busy transportation hub.
 Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial centre surrounded by a huge bay and mountains.
 Between the wide tree-lined avenues, glass-walled buildings and modern shopping malls, there are traditional red-tiled houses, 18th-century markets and ancient mosques and churches, but the city has a Mediterranean European feel rather than the traditional Turkish one.
 In Haldarsvík you can enjoy the view of the nearby island of Eysturoy. The village has a unique octagonal church.
 The church cemetery has some interesting marble bird sculptures on top of the graves.
 A half-hour stroll through this charming village is well worth it.
 To the north, you can easily reach the romantic Sintra town, which is the Lord Byron's famous paradise and is known to foreigners.
 The Scotturb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at the Cabo da Roca.
 You can also visit the Basilica of the Virgin Mary in the North, which is the place where the Virgin Mary appeared.
 Remember, you are actually visiting a huge mass grave site that has a huge meaning for a large group of people in the world.
 There are still many men and women who survived here, who are still alive today; and many more whose relatives were killed there, or who worked as slaves until they died, Jews and non-Jews alike.
 Please give this place the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
 Do not mark or graffiti on the buildings to avoid damaging the site.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand Catalan, while Spanish is understood by almost everyone.
 However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as this is the first official language, as stipulated by law.
 However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
 The regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system makes announcements in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
 Parisians are notorious for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to behave as well as possible and to present yourself as a person with “bien élevé” (good manners). This will make it much easier to take part in social activities.
 If you show a little basic courtesy, the Parisian rudeness will soon disappear.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests of beech, fir and spruce, and is characterized by a combination of mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
 Because of the variety of microclimates, soils and elevations, the flora is extremely rich and diverse, and is thus famous.
 The area is also home to a variety of animals and birds.
 There you can see rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, hawks, lynxes, foxes and wild cats, as well as many more common species.
 Women must wear skirts that are knee-length or longer when visiting the abbey, and their shoulders must be covered.
 Most monasteries will provide a wrap for women who are not dressed appropriately, but if you are wearing something that is particularly bright, the monks at the door will give you a wink.
 Similarly, men must wear long pants to cover their knees.
 You can also borrow from the cloakroom at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so these dresses may feel a little uncomfortable to wear.
 The cuisine of the island is similar to that of the Mediterranean, with a base of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and the use of olive oil.
 Pa amb Oli is a simple summer supper: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever toppings you have on hand, like cheese, tuna, etc.
 All nouns except those that are used to address you as “Sie” should be capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
 This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and their objects.
 This also makes reading easier, although it makes writing more complicated, because you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
 Italian is relatively easy to pronounce because most words are pronounced exactly the same as they are spelled.
 The main letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation is based on the following vowels.
 Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: “caro” means “dear” while “carro” means “cart.”
 Persian grammar is relatively simple and regular.
 Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you master more Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
 Undoubtedly, if you speak a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
 However, anyone who knows a little Spanish may be tempted to conclude that Portuguese is very similar to Spanish and that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
 Nowadays, most of the pre-modern observatories have been decommissioned and are preserved as museums or educational facilities.
 Because light pollution was not as severe in their heyday, observatories were often built in urban areas or on college campuses, making them easier to reach than modern observatories.
 Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
 Hanami, also known as “flower viewing,” has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
 This concept originated in China, where the peony is a popular flower.
 In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the royal family at the imperial palace.
 Plants are at their best in their natural environment. So resist the temptation to pick them, even if it is “just one.”
 If you are visiting a carefully landscaped garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you ejected, with no room for negotiation.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place, navigation is easy and once you arrive you can buy almost anything.
 But because you are in the “hot tropics” a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to deal with both high temperatures (year-round) and strong sun (which is relatively rare when the weather is clear).
 Several buses also headed north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
 Please confirm that the bus you intend to take will enter Hebron, and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a good theme for a holiday.
 For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise on the Danube River to see the fun cities along the river.
 They also marked out the route for popular walking and cycling routes.
 Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
 Many traditions associated with this holiday are also embraced by non-Christian nations and non-Christians around the world.
 One tradition is to watch the sunrise on Easter morning outside.
 Of course, this tradition has its Christian theological explanation, but it is very likely that it was a spring festival, a ritual of praying for a good harvest, that existed before the birth of Christ.
 More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday nights, with the congregation usually flooding in at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
 Initially, the animals arrived on the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
 Because they are far from the mainland, mammals cannot travel long distances to get there, making the giant turtle the main herbivore on the Cocos Islands.
 When humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
 If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience polar nights, when the sun does not rise for a period of time.
 This provides a great opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
 These areas are sparsely populated, and there is generally no light pollution, so you can enjoy a brilliant night sky.
 Compared to the work culture of Westerners, the work culture of Japanese people is more obvious and more formal.
 Business attire is standard, and colleagues refer to each other by their last names or titles.
 A harmonious workplace atmosphere is essential, emphasizing team effort rather than individual achievement.
 Employees must get approval from their superiors for any decision they make and must unconditionally obey their instructions.
