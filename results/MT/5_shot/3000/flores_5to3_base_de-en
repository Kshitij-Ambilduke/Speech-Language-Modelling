 This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
 Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid-colored on the underside.
 The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
 Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
 The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for showing off. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
 The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not downy feathers.
 A car bomb exploded in the morning of yesterday in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killing two policemen and wounding over twenty other people.
 According to the governor's office, 19 of the injured are police officers.
 Police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
 They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
 To determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow, the luminosity and the rotation are combined.
 The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

 The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
 The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
 Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
 The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
 This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.
 Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
 Local authorities are urging residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not to drink tap water.

 "Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it does match what you would expect from deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
 In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and slip a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is written, into an envelope.
 After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
 French election law sets the timetable quite strictly.
 Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are present at the start of the election and that no ballots are added except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
 The candidates can send representatives who will witness every part of the process. At the end of the day, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and special procedures.

 Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and seized her mobile phone and laptop."
 The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
 Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
 Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them was injured.
 The driver suffered serious head injuries.
 The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
 He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
 He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
 Adekoya was meanwhile charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
 She is in custody pending trial, but witness statements may be tainted because her picture has been widely published.
 This is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
 Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
 The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made until the indictment.
 According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand a return to the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
 Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
 Israel is demanding a 10-year military presence in the Jordan Valley from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to accept a five-year presence.
 The guards of the accompanying trial to contain the plague should be closely supervised by Rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
 As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
 According to Mick O’Flynn, the chief executive of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training.
 Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members.
 It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
 Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
 The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
 The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
 Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
 The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
 "Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
 The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really regrettable."
 The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
 The Northern Marianas Office of Homeland Security said no damage was reported in the country.
 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
 A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
 Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
 Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
 Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
 The photographers took the place of an older woman when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
 Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
 He trained as a midwife and took up his work in the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
 While working in the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
 His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
 Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday retrieved two "black box" flight recorders.
 Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
 "Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
 Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
 Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
 During the 2010 federal election campaign, the then-acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
 34 percent of respondents agree with this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never become a republic.
 The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events as well as in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his many complaints.
 He was not able to take the required medication to overcome his pain as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
 On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
 Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
 Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
 Since comets collided with the Earth long ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, are formed.
 Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
 He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
 It is speculated that he could run for the office of President in 2016.
 NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
 It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
 No additional transportation is being provided and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking facilities or park-and-ride sites available on site.
 With the concern over lack of transportation, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
 A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
 Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved within just two generations, whereas it was previously thought that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
 Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
 It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
 It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, which are called illuminated manuscripts.
 This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
 The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how sour or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
 The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
 Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
 Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
 The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
 The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
 Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
 Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
 When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
 The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down to Earth.
 The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view somewhat.
 It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
 The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the bicycle has rendered us is very much simpler and faster transportation.
 It has brought us the railroad, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
 Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
 Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
 The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
 Lions are the most social of cats. They live in large groups called prides.
 The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and young.
 Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
 Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog prides, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are just as deadly to their prey.
 As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with the force of five times a strong man.
 The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, the only four cats that can roar.
 The roar of the tiger does not sound like the boastful roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of grumbling roared words.
 Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
 Scientists think that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate prey. They sniff where they have been on the ground.
 They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
 If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it is moved to a new island so that it cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
 This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it previously needed.
 The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
 Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
 After thousands or even millions of years, two populations may look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
 We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
 Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
 Plants produce their food through photosynthesis with the sun as their source of energy. They also provide shade.
 We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
 The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
 Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
 We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
 He also grabbed anything that came into the water; even a big dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
 While we know most of their food, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-bander.
 Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich men preferred to hold joint banquets, where they lay on their sides while they ate their meals.
 The courts of ancient Rome could not contain any foodstuffs that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
 They had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman had ever eaten a turkey.
 The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
 They brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
 Each temple had an open temple court and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
 Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
 The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
 In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not have such a great significance.
 Most of the Hebrew family's life played out in the open air.
 The women cooked in the yard. Shops consisted of simply open shop windows. Stone was used for house building.
 There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
 Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that when he continued westward he found Greenland and gave it its name.
 But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
 Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
 If you have seen the movie "The Templar Legacy," you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
 That is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words “original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.” The text is upside down on the bottom of the document.
 While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
 It is therefore possible that the notation was simply added as a marking.
 The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
 "It was ruled by the Vichy French. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the conquerors, rather than fighting them."
 On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
 After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
 A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together in a society.
 The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
 City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a proper distribution.
 Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
 During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress.
 The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state governments to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
 He also had no power to suspend tax laws and tariffs between the states.
 The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
 The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
 Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
 Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
 Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
 "Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is geographically often referred to as an ""archipelago"".
 The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailed past and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
 In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in the rice farming methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
 In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
 In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
 Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
 Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
 By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
 For example, the most widely used format for still images is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
 It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
 In fact, the so-called 35 mm format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
 The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
 Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
 The much-maligned and often derided Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and at the same time preserves a measure of order in a picture.
 It states that the intersection of the lines that divide a picture into thirds vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
 In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
 For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together, despite their different languages and customs.
 His power controlled everyone, from the king to the commoner.
 One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that it is for this reason that the Church has the means to do so.
 The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being adhered to.
 Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
 The strategy proved effective in cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
 Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
 Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
 In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
 After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
 In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
 He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
 Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each era in China and each family that was in power was a dynasty.
 Between the individual dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces, the best known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
 In these times, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
 The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
 There are a lot of social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one ruler alone.
 After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
 The same was true for the military, because instead of being based on class membership, the army rankings were now based on caliber.
 The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
 Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
 The cave itself has survived the ages and provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
 The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 It is not easy to find, even if you know it exists, and once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
 You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
 The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
 Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
 The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
 The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
 The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "spread" symbol like a bracket or a square, in which the lower line is missing.
 Up means you start at the top and push the bow. Down means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
 Scratching usually generates a softer sound, while scraping is more powerful and expressive.
 You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed page markings are there for musical reasons and should be respected.
 The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
 They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were shouting threats at the king and queen.
 The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
 At some point, a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
 The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
 They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
 Of course, the superprofits, which were derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people, represented the basic gains of US imperialism.
 To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
 The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
 The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
 Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by an underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
 Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and second, that technology itself has “effects” on societies that are inherent rather than socially caused.
 One could argue that the automobile has inevitably led to the development of roads.
 However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
 The widespread automobile ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
 Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
 In the context of romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily octroiated laws.
 Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
 Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
 His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
 At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
 The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
 At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
 However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels.
 Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
 Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
 Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic farming method that uses saved, indigenous seed stock and combines with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
 In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case.
 Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
 Subcultures can be distinguished from other subcultures in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
 The properties that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical or a combination of these factors.
 Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
 One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood, have not been socialized by adults.
 "Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical disabilities."
 Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
 Others may have been raised by animals; some may have lived alone in the wild.
 If it was raised completely by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of his specific caretaker, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
 While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the "Scaffolding" goes one step further.
 Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
 Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clipboard man in Microsoft Office.
 Virtual help is built into the software and should question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone may not be able to cope with.
 Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
 No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
 For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children.
 Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
 The foster home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were taken.
 The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication.
 The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach.
 For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 "Personal commitment" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to Web sites.
 The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
 In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression.x
 In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
 He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
 Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
 Mutation provides new genetic variation and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variation.
 Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
 Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
 Moreover, it has serious consequences if one fails to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
 The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
 In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
 Overall, it should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to the way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
 Sleep deprivation is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
 This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to alert you without fully waking you up.
 If you are someone who sets the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
 Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid before bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect), so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
 The degree of inner peace a person has correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
 The less stress, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
 Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
 Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
 In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
 With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
 The center of Tibetan meditation is the God-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises.
 Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
 Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
 It was to last the next 40 years and in reality would be played out on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places by proxy armies.
 On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
 These plans were however made obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
 The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
 The Navy's traditional role was to ensure that a nation remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
 One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II, when the Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
 At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
 Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
 Goats were apparently already domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
 Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and hides.
 House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pasture lands.  They were tended by goatherds, much like the more familiar shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
 As early as the 16th century, in England, conveyor belts were built.
 Although the tram tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
 Very early on, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was gradually recognized that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient.
 This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
 Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
 The first known mode of transportation was walking. Man began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means “upright man”).
 Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn’t walk upright so regularly.
 Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
 We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
 That's just like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. If you want to get rid of the problem permanently, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
 It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious.
 After its passage by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
 Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
 The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
 One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
 The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript has not survived the ages.
 Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still living today. We call them birds.
 Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
 But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
 They have feet with claws and lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
 Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
 A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
 An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
 The best sign of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
 Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
 The term "Wasps" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
 This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
 Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or housing of their hosts.
 In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
 MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
 Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
 A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
 These couples can choose to adopt a plan for their baby.
 In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over parenting.
 The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
 It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
 Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
 Aristotle's views on all scientific matters including psychology were accepted.
 With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
 Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
 Behaviours determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
 Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can keep a steady rhythm for a while even in the absence of external signals.
 The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
 Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
 They took two experiments, in which they either labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
 Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the piece of genetic material in question has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
 Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
 Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
 Examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
 An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
 Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
 In this dynamic pendulum movement, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
 Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
 Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
 In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
 Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent or is something more fundamental going on?
 Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
 Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
 Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a somewhat consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
 To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
 These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the roadway.
 Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them to evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
 Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
 This gives them a wider selection of small hiding places in which they can hide from predators.
 Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
 Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements.
 Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
 This seems reasonable, since it does not seem as if the Earth is moving, does it?
 The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
 The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
 As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
 The Amazon main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
 Although the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
 Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
 The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
 The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
 Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
 All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
 Basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to man since antiquity, as all of these can be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools.
 Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
 This corresponded more to the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also put forward the theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
 Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
 Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
 There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
 The universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
 Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
 As a result, the pencil after its invention became a good friend to many people.
 Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
 Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter.
 One can only wait and see what will come out of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
 The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
 It is like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split again, some of this energy is released.
 Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they will decay at the slightest or no provocation.
 The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
 The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
 It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
 On the near side, there could be more Maria because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
 Internal theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
 These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood.
 These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things.
 Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
 In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
 This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
 At the other end of the spectrum, you become a different individual, who has to do everything differently than the team did and take everything for granted.
 Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
 This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
 Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
 Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
 They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local management.
 The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
 "The ""invisible team"" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
 Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
 When all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
 As a result, the collective work of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method to meet customer needs.
 Before an organization can be innovative, management must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
 Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
 Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus delimiting the field of research and making it much more precise.
 The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
 It has long been known that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
 New technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
 It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head.
 Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a major branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
 Research in the field of AI involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
 Examples include control, the establishment of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
 Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
 Today, AI systems are widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and have been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games.
 Field trips are an important part of any school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
 Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from their classroom.
 Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
 For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web site each year about their trip to the state capital. The web site is redesigned each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
 Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students may have poor grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually improves when they have an audience.
 Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
 Blogging “forces students to learn more about the world around them.” The need to engage the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
 Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
 The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and articulate their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
 Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
 Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled beauty of nature stretches into Muskoka and beyond.
 All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
 Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
 A population comparison that many will be surprised by: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
 The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
 Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
 Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
 The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
 European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese seafarer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
 In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
 Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
 Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
 Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed, etc.
 Stay consistent when you reject men, and don’t be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences be damned; that doesn’t mean it’s OK!)
 The present-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
 The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
 The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
 Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
 Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of Tinnef are sold, but that is only for tourists.
 Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
 In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
 While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to stay abreast of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
 The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
 You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.x
 This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has led to the term "Timbuktu" becoming a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
 Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor city.
 In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
 It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
 The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic than an African feel.
 The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
 The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different animal life.
 It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
 Like all South African national parks, the park charges a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
 It can also be worth buying a Wild Card, which gives access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
 Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
 The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering bar chart, which is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
 For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
 Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanization is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
 This is the place the British colonists made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
 The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
 The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is called Sundarbans National Park.
 The forests are not only mangrove swamps, however – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
 The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
 The Sundarbans have been a protected area since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
 Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
 As the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
 Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
 Shared taxis offer a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
 The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
 Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
 The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic was not until March 2017.
 The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
 The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
 The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
 Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
 The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
 Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
 Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
 The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
 Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.x
 Information on competitions and places to buy polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
 The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
 Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
 The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards are also widely accepted. US dollars are also often accepted.
 On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and US currency can be accepted; inquire in advance with the owners which method of payment is accepted.
 It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
 Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
 Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 ° C are common.
 Winter can be deceivingly cold: Temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
 There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less the same throughout the year.
 Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
 According to the Park Authority, visitors must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
 No matter how peaceful bison, moose, elk, bears and practically all large animals may appear, they can still attack.
 Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
 Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep a clean camp.
 Apia is the capital of Samoa and has a population of just under 40,000.
 Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
 The harbor was the site of an infamous standoff between the Navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
 All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
 During the Mau movement's campaign for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
 Since Auckland stretches over two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
 The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
 Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade, provided by Pohutukawa trees.
 The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
 There are family beaches, which are sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
 The most important local beer is “Number One”. It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
 There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more palatable.
 The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water easily available.
 "For Australians, the idea of a flat white is foreign. A small black is an espresso, cappuccino is topped high with foam (not froth) and tea is served without milk."
 Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
 Many diving trips take place all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
 Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and especially pay attention to safety warnings.
 Jellyfish occur in the vicinity of beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this timeframe.
 Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
 Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
 A reservation in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
 Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agency.x
 Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
 They can also hold your reservation for you in case you need time to reconsider your offer or to get additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
 Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
 At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
 If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
 Remember that some parts of the festival will still be playing music until late into the night, even after the main stages have stopped.
 Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
 If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite horrible noise for those most affected.
 Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
 Casinos are usually very concerned about keeping guests on site for as long as possible and spending a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
 They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to make sure they stay.
 Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
 If you are going to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
 On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
 In blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
 The visibility may also be impaired by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
 On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to run mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
 Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
 The term safari in common language refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
 Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
 Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
 A foot safari (also called a bushwalk, trek or footing) is a hike that can last anywhere from a few hours to several days.
 The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events held at other venues across Japan.
 Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, after having already hosted the Games in 1964.
 If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
 Cancellation policies vary, but by late March most cancellation policies because of the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
 It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
 Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
 If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
 Be careful not to heat the fabric too much (it can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, cause burns).
 There are various methods for purifying water. Some of them are more effective in countering certain hazards.
 In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
 The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
 Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
 Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, poison or transmit diseases.
 Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with violence are usually not classified as pests.
 Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from certain taxes and consumption taxes in certain places.
 Travellers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
 The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the biggest driving challenge, as it often goes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
 If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves prevail here.
 The speed limits are markedly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
 But interestingly, cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
 German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite hearty and varied, as well as in the southern neighbor Austria.
 Fruit bread is widespread, with apples being baked into bread year-round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
 Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
 If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
 A curry is a dish that is based on spices and herbs, along with either meat or vegetables.
 A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid used.
 In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
 With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
 However, when used without further attributes, the term generally refers to the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
 The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese prefer peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices as flavor carriers.
 Martingales are aids for the feet of riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
 They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
 If a rider falls off a horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
 First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
 Additionally, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a stirrup leather to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
 The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a plethora of big granite walls and cliffs.
 The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are always discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
 Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which one attaches skis or a snowboard to one's feet and rides down a snow-covered slope.
 Skiing is a popular form of recreation with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular resort.
 The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
 The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
 Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
 It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include these, as the latter is done in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
 Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
 In good conditions you are able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
 Europe is a relatively small continent, but has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport controls if one wanted to travel through several countries.
 In this respect, however, the Schengen area works a little like a country.
 As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
 Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
 There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as objects over 100 years old.
 The definition has geographical variations, where the age of consent may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
 Handmade products could be called "antique", although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
 Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
 Even in the past, not all Sámi have raised reindeer on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar. Reindeer were mainly used as draft animals.
 Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
 "Even if the term 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma."
 If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
 You can also consult the advice of other governments than your own. Their advice is, however, tailored to their own citizens.
 For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
 Consultations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
 The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
 A storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
 Weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of weather that depend on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
 Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods and cyclones.
 Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
 Travellers are urged to pay attention to any type of weather that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
 Anyone who plans to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
 A search on the Internet for "Course on hostile environments" will probably show the address of a local company.
 A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
 A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
 There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
 Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
 The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
 The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
 Security checks at airports have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
 Transgender people before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when passing through the scanners.
 Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the beach, often at reefs or the like.
 Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there, even to deep water.
 Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
 When you get out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
 Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
 The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
 For those who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, it is sometimes difficult to adapt to their own culture again.
 When you come back from a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and dropped some of your home culture's behaviours.
 When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adjust to a new place.
 One might not expect that even returning travelers need patience and understanding.
 The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
 You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
 Normally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The history of the sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
 The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
 The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being lit up.
 The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations, with sixteen active in 2020.
 The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
 Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
 Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
 The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
 The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,050 ft).
 In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
 A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in clear view of a satellite to make a call.
 The service is often used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring data and voice communications.
 Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about the connection to this service.
 An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year out is to study or take a course abroad.
 This is very popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
 In many cases, participation in an overseas gap year program can actually improve your chances of getting into a college or university in your home country.
 As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these educational programs.
 Finland is a great destination for boating. The “Land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
 For the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
 Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
 Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or seven people owning a boat.
 This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
 Most pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
 This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days, while returning in the evening and spending the night on the ship.
 If you only go on shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
 Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
 Flying can be a daunting experience for people of any age and from any walk of life, especially if they have never flown before or have a traumatic experience.
 There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
 Learning more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome the fear that comes with the unknown or with the feeling of not having any control.
 Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often the time is a very important factor in business documents, trade goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
 On some routes the larger firms use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller firms difficulties arose.
 When they shipped things via air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
 The only way to get it through faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. The airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
 The obvious method of flying first or business class is to fork out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to pay for it).
 This is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times the normal economy fare for first class!
 In general, it is pointless to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
 Airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
 The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
 Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
 This conflict led to the founding of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
 Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova could be restored.
 The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
 Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
 The once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and busy business center, located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
 The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are punctuated by classic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than the traditional Turkish one.
 The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
 On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of pigeons on some graves.
 It is worth taking a half-hour stroll through the fascinating village.
 To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendour in vivid colours.
 The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Cabo da Roca and Sintra.
 Also visit in the north the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
 Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave and a place that has almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world population.
 There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
 Please treat this place with the dignity, awe and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
 Do not deface the site by painting or scratching graffiti.
 The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
 Most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the official language.
 Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
 Normal announcements are made in the Metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
 Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
 Even if this is often only an inaccurate cliché, one finds oneself in Paris best if one shows one's best side and behaves like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make it much easier to get along.
 The brusque exterior of the Parisian quickly disappears when you follow basic manners.
 The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
 It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities due to its numerous microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
 The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
 There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and capercaillie as well as many generally more common species.
 When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and cover their shoulders.
 In most monasteries there are indeed wrap dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
 Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach over the knee.
 These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these dresses. For all men there is a standard size!
 The cuisine of Majorca is based, as in similar Mediterranean areas, on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
 A simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any other ingredients available such as cheese, tuna etc.
 "All nouns start with a capital letter next to the word Sie for 'you', even in the middle of a sentence."
 This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
 It makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is used as the main word.
 Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
 The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
 "Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "love", while carro means "chariot.""
 Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
 Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
 If you speak a romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
 People who speak some Spanish might be tempted to think that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned.
 Pre-modern observatories are nowadays usually no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
 Since light pollution was not as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to access than those built more recently.
 Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
 The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
 The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
 In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court.
 "Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove just one."
 If you visit a formally laid out garden and take "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
 Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and you can find almost anything you need after you arrive.
 Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
 There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
 Make sure that the bus you take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
 Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
 For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
 They also represent popular hiking and biking routes.
 In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
 Many of the traditions around the holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
 There is a tradition of spending Easter night at some open place to see the sunrise.
 There are of course Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
 Traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the communities often beginning at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
 All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew or washed ashore.
 Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main source of food on the Galapagos Islands.
 Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
 If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
 This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less all night.
 Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
 The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
 Suits are part of the standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
 Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, with the focus being on group performance rather than on praise for individual achievements.
 Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' orders without question.
