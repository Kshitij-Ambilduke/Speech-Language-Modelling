 groups like iceland can still film this void by spreading their false narrative using social media tools that young people communicate through creating a false impression that they join a fight for a good cause against the oppressive regimes

 to conclude footnote is an essential element
 what would be crucial is to add the cost of not acting and not regulating 
 and amplify losses from the collapse of the housing bubble

 the same holds true for the intention to reinforce the provisions on market surveillance in order to ensure proper and even proper and timely harmonised enforcement of the injunctions directive and its implementing measures

 however not all the essential goods are covered for that reason the eu has negotiated this agreement 
 double your o two after eighteen years of negotiations 
 i m gonna go to the next slide 
 the cooperation on human rights summit was a disappointment in many respects 
 this document should be considered therefore as a stepping stone for the total ban of atomic weapons

 for more than four months elected politicians and civil society leaders have been imprisoned in pretrial detention for their political activities 
 an agreement will be possible only if we see concrete action and real change in the government legislation

 nevertheless they have been using all legal possibilities to prevent the verzari family from happening

 but military interventions are no excuse for human rights violations and the government of musharraf has the responsibility to protect its citizens not make them fear for their lives

 we all know amen as a successful stable country a role model for the whole region 
 for example i think especially now with the current proposal of next year s mff have in mind that probably the share of financial instruments will even bigger a well balanced investment bank should guarantee a well balanced injections of these financial instruments 
 we like to have a hearing on constraining on sustainability on both sides very soon 
 and should these be offensive then they can be tackled via a fourth right debate 
 at that time the commission and the council including the uk government failed to embrace the idea 
 our president sir we must constantly keep in mind that as members of the european union we have signed up to a core set of democratic principles and rights

 now we face the problem where the vpsps export import will expire into weeks 
 this sentiment has been strengthened by widespread corruption and lack of implementation of much needed reforms 
 efficiency is important but we also must spend 2018 profits
 and a cultural shift here in europe from savings to investment is critical 
 we want to use the opportunities that we have to build on the work that we have done to achieve an ambitious life we want to be building an inclusive club here and by bringing ukrainians and the others closer to the eu we should also see them as bridge builders it is key that there is a dialogue between brussels and kiev and we want to see the eu we should also see them as bridge builders it is key that there is a dialogue between brussels and kiev and we want to see the eu we should also see them as bridge

 and national competitiveness the commission is also very clear that this independent assessment is strongly linked to the availability of the human and financial resources however 
 the country in a high profile situation when it is not capable of controlling its borders and when it is not willing to get an assistance from the agency which is just an assistance for the work of sovereignty reasons can also lead to a situation where member countries decide to introduce further controls at their borders because
 they even planned to shift the election in russia to celebrate the occupation of crimea 
 we worked our hardest in terms of definition of energy poverty 
 parliament also approves to national law makers to clearly distinguish high risk or low risk or low equity assets from those assets which are eligible for use as collateral for securitisation investment funds leaving as a minimum instructions to a new instrument which as i have said would be called european secured notes

 we can t do it if we take a new decision 
 the international committee has to admit officially that mass rape in congo is a war crime against humanity 
 these statements have not received any criticisms either inside or outside the lithuanian ruling elite 
 therefore the classification of security personnel special entities as financial counterparties recently released in a commission draft report seems to contradict and threaten what we have achieved in the security legislation 
 and
 it is time for us to bring some of the discretionary spending into this discussion on eu spending member states instead of allowing the euro skeptics to band around misleading statistics and inflammatory rhetoric should sometimes use by ukip leading the euro sceptics in the uk as a reason for ukip leaving the eu last week in the uk and new zealand 
 our citizens deserve it

 behind this inevitable brutality there are thousands of stories with names and faces but let me tell you about one today 
 so i think we should stick to the saying if it s not broke don t fix it 
 therefore council president i urge you to get your acts together 
 but i am proud that the high representative is british too and that her personal success demonstrates how british foreign policy can sit comfortably at the heart of today s european union 
 the lebanese people are sick and tired of having to be resilient and i understand them 
 and it is not required to set out reasons for the decision 
 indeed this agency will not be a silver bullet and it will not solve every and each issue in european union but we must not lose sight that this is a highly important fundamental piece in the larger puzzle of our european union policy 
 it is not business as usual and the american chamber of commerce in brussels is the basis for this agreement 
 you know that we work with the electoral act from 2006 and i hope that you team and especially you mr president will be able to support that and especially you colleagues can bring that to a positive result 
 the court of auditors with the kwintra report with the kwintra and the pactic concerns the union s cooperation with seventy eight countries

 and
 what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to enable the industry to become more competitive

 the romania is an american colony 
 russia is not only active in ukraine as we know but also in georgia it s active in a cyber way in the baltic states so this is the russian policy

 unfortunately this is just an aspect of a more complex picture that includes several violation of human rights ranging from the well known situation in darfur to international criminal law concerns 
 so i think we should be very cautious in relation to what we do in terms of making any decision to suspend development 
 therefore it is high time you come forward with a proposal for a review with an operational separation of the audit and non audit services under a direct eu
 i would remind you that at the deta summit in april 2015 you accepted that if there is a reason we are willing to do more to engage in having a high economic growth it is because there is an increase in the commission s i have twenty seven million good reasons to do more that is why i have an appeal to you today to do more 
 however the focus should be on principles not on specific cases or countries

 however their cases represent only the tip of the iceberg as far as prostitution is concerned marketed sexual exploitation is concerned this motion recalls the names of many other crimes such as human trafficking child prostitution and other victims and as meps must remain vigilant and act in a coordinated manner this motion
 so it is therefore important for all of us to keep this in mind during future discussions 
 the commission is also working on biodegradable plastics keeping international trade flowing is vital for the global demand for eu and other exports the commission is making efforts to ensure that the g20 trade restrictive and discriminatory measures in response to the crisis have a minimal impact on eu exports despite commitments by the g20 to make biodiesel and bioethanol as well as plastics biodegradable

 i think that greece will be enslaved by this financial burden for years to come 
 i do not trust the uk government and eu negotiations 
 i am both grateful and both concerned that the government has failed to take steps when they were needed and in that i see a parallel with the europe our ancestors fought for and the belarus we try not to lose right now 
 i believe in the democracy and the equality of races 
 and again it stinks through the great work of investigation journalists that this scandal is revealed 
 we can even use the experience from a different area of policy the visa waiver regime 
 ah in the case of roma it was racism against roma and cannot and should not be tolerated anywhere

 we need to build a legislation on disinforming content 
 enough pretending that we don t understand who and with whom arms is killing and that
 to reintroduce them now would be completely contradictory to the fisheries reform and the fsg will not support that 
 but despite great ambitions we are not yet at that point 
 this is not expenditure this is not spending this is an investment in the future of this union 
 ladies and gentlemen the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of a very intensive and i would say sometimes difficult negotiations and compromises between council and parliament

 as those two had i believe i believe in equal treatment and we can deal with an opinion 
 let me just make this very clear the commission has not made or less ambitious realistic or less realistic or more or less willing to pay we need four clarities because too much is at stake we need a clear and ambitious political stance 
 i am of course very much aware of the need for a political reason why we should be able to act ourselves 
 and we better unite next time and that is one voice 
 but when i read the franco german memorandum s letter i saw the same old tired repetition of our positions and preferences which have so far singly failed to prompt israel to properly govern action 
 that this debate shows that we are we go hand in hand in the same direction 
 in this respect i would like to highlight three key issues 
 i let let everybody speak a little bit longer if you don t mind i don t open this procedure up because we are running late

 his house the parliament no just how difficult in how intractable the situation may be 
 in these cases the european commission within its competences has quickly responded in the framework of crisis and solidarity mechanisms in the eu and worldwide 
 it distinguishes the two main user human rights abused by the current government and the iranian nuclear program 
 and so does the rhetoric of world leaders when appropriate and when attending climate change conferences

 there are also a few shortcomings 
 there is no such medical technique or treatment which could permit us to cross this internationally agreed principle of non modification of human germ line 
 with full respect to our national cultures we can build the pillars of our common cultural architecture for the years to come i am sure that many events that will be happening throughout the year will successfully spread this message in this context 
 if bafin does not do its job germany will lose its reputation in the financial world and investors will lose confidence 
 the eu has been preventing entry of families of asylum seekers parliamentary delegations human rights organisations lawyers and journalists and even doctors to the camp and do not allow many local medical materials to get into al rafah

 another thing we can have ah simplified audit swot introducing more simplified approach and removing unnecessary requirements 
 parents in full feeling their responsibilities are entitled to receive the necessary support from the community and the local authorities who efforts to meet their obligation unfortunately of
 let s give our citizens the opportunity to choose a transnationalist giving people their right to choose this is democracy 
 the adoption of the resolution as his said will make his mission close to impossible 
 of course i have often said that the commissioner s proposals are not acceptable to the eu i have often said that the control of the budget will go a long way to achieving the necessary playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned just as the development of the trade pillar playing field will go a long way to achieving the necessary pl
 mr president i would like to thank you for allowing me to put this very simple question 
 this amendment by senator biden has nothing to do with the lack of payment appropriations 
 i really hope through your vote tomorrow you will give us your support not to lose any of these achievements 
 more rules and regulation will not improve this situation

 phil that this house is better than and doesn t accept

 the court will remain doing its best when responding to the needs of the european taxpayers owning them on the quality of the eu spending finally respect to the commission s proposal for their acceptance of our creative and their enthusiasm for the commission s and their enthusiasm for spending the future spending schemes

 another important consultation for the ep group has always been the independence of the commissions impact assessment 
 if we want dignity and stability we need to invest in respect for human rights also by our companies instead of in arms and defence we also saw the tragic pictures of the attack in las vegas

 such decision must be followed by actions with appropriate budget 
 one the words others than the united states should be deleted from the heading and the remarks as decided by the committee on budget 
 the reason repeatedly given is that the eu doesn t have the data for individual member states and for that reason will not even attempt to give me an estimate as to how many have gained from our fishing grounds as i said that the eu has gained from our fishing grounds is indisputable that the refuse to even give an estimate of that value from all data they do have is not acceptable

 some stakeholders have emerged this week of children being possibly trafficked and even abused 
 it is ethically and legally unacceptable to permit creation of embryos with dna from three parents 
 we also have an internal problem
