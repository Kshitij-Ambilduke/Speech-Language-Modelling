 ah you should be able to find it 
 i think we have to have a lesson to continue to face the long term challenge of the post oil age by diversifying our resources and technologies

 they will seek to destroy jobs across the european union to drive down pay and conditions and environmental standards both in britain and in the eu i urge the european council to hold firm in rejecting british provocation in asserting international law and in defending the interests of ireland and the eu 
 just to say once again it is the youngest nation in europe and we are not so rich in young people in the interest of the continent

 if serious about climate change the co op nineteen conference should speed up their commitments on meaningful and binding targets for c o two reduction 
 and
 it worries me a bit that the commission calls these indicators auxiliary 
 i think the supply side instrument we understand that it is difficult to create its own demand especially in the infrastructure and innovation window because it was not included in the set of things like that for the creation of this demand and the fact is very few of the projects were additional 
 groups like isis can still fill this void by spreading their false narrative using social media tools that young people communicate through creating a false impression that they join a fight for a good cause against the oppressive regimes

 while the united states spends trillions of dollars on security europe is slow or idle in developing our own strategy 
 it is obvious that boris was killed by forces that spread darkness aggression and hate in russia

 i am political prisoners in spain and so i am asking you do we really accept that eu governments repress political dissent through arbitrary detention 
 when we look at the labour market then one third of jobs will be deeply influenced by this transformation 
 second it is very disappointing that the council has once again made unnecessary cuts to the programmes in the area of citizenship 
 underlines that power should be transferred to democratically elected civilian authorities as soon as possible 
 we have to deliver added value for our societies 
 what the commissioner has said in these respects has been very welcome and i hope for great support for this excellent report

 how it is possible that even today when we designate our era as one of which respects the most fundamental values of life and human dignity that the united kingdom does not act in the best interests of its citizens

 the us is a sovereign country and only accountable to its own citizens 
 first 2019 is not only the year of the european elections but it also could be the first year after the withdrawal of a member state therefore it is of paramount importance to keep the communication with european citizens open we have to increase our efforts to engage them
 this motion calls for our joint solidarity with the people of the crimea especially of the local tatar community whose members and leaders are moscow s main targets in repressing and revenging opposition similarly to representatives of the free press 
 you have warned of severe consequences 
 only this could help equip emff with the real strike force
 how are we going to measure whether the influx is high not high high enough when it s all over the european union has to decide whether it wants to act or react

 human life security is more important 
 the economic burden of these diseases is putting pressure on the member states and the cost significantly increased with the progression of the disease

 some member states understand cybersecurity only as the protection of hackers and it is much more than that

 the key achievement is russia s commitment not to impose new or additional export duties 
 the digital finance report is a good basis 
 the european parliament defended the interests of the citizens competitive markets and small operators 
 the commission has not discouraged them 
 we have sanctions they should be continued but it is also possible if russia goes on this way that we increase these sanctions and have more smart sanctions against russia 
 we need the focus on deepening and strengthening the internal market to make sure that all single market strategies are completed by 2018 especially of course the digital single market 
 that said and given the absence of relevant treaty provision the council has no further power to take action in the areas mentioned by the honourable members 
 the compromise also includes clear rules to define which member state has jurisdiction and the cooperation with the member states concerning for cross border cases as well as the need to involve eurojust thank you for your work and please do support tomorrow this directive 
 varsaov is the meeting which is not procedural 
 we all know at this stage that draft amending budget 6 is urgently needed and should therefore be adopted without delay 
 an active and effective european union contributes to the overall security of the euro atlantic area 
 therefore there is a lot of work ahead of us

 we clearly stated that this is not meant for the small companies but the smes the statute is available for all companies 
 we are democrats and we support the right of kosovo to be an independent state recognised by most of the states in the international community

 this year s european foreign policy school has already shown the british government prepared to give up leadership in six out of 19 areas of european foreign policy despite the overall finding that in only one year has there even been minor divergence between eu and uk goals 
 i hear that the intention is to have a message and i hear that you intend to do something to help those who suffer most

 it calls upon the commission and the member states to connect and boost efforts towards further sustaining peace and conflict prevention and recalls the worldwide inspiration brought about by the good friday agreement while acknowledging the unprecedented challenges and pressures on the aftermath of the united kingdom s twenty six june referendum

 to conclude football is an essential element
 what would be crucial is to add the cost of not acting and not regulating 
 and amplify losses from the collapse of the housing bubble 
 at the same time deeper international engagement remains essential 
 which is in the heart of his portfolio 
 bearing in mind the divergent expectations and concerns of the different stakeholder groups and the different aspects we had to take into account i am convinced that we have achieved a more than respectable result 
 we think the commission and the national competent authorities should focus human and financial resources to get knowledge and skill to implement the competition rules in the digital economy 
 the agreement of the report is a direct consequence of an ongoing fashionable green ideology stating that we must put nature and the planet first that we cannot take care of people their needs and interests the only amendments calling for further progress of nuclear energy and supporting a headway in the nuclear fusion can hardly be

 it is worth considering whether this system can deliver the desired results for all stakeholders a better targeted eu spending 
 the decision of the us to go back on its pledge to the green climate fund leaves a major void 
 we more than doubled funding to fight ebola 
 the eu will not be able to finance their green dream if the financial world cannot rely on the bubble

 mr president the electronic link between the amendments to the budget did not work in the system when we prepared the
 it goes without saying that the union may only adopt legislation where the treaties provide for the power to do so 
 this is of utmost importance and should be the driver of any action taken 
 the mre review for example needs to be very specifically about finding solutions to the unintended consequences and burdens that we have placed upon non financial companies

 these negotiations show the potential of cooperation between like minded partners like us 
 and
 the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis à vis the citizens our role as a parliament is accountability we are the citizens we cannot and we must not say to the citizens that a big common policy like the external and defence policy will lie outside the democratic control of our parliament 
 the same holds true for the intention to reinforce the provisions on market surveillance in order to ensure proper and widespread enforcement of the injury limiting directive and its implementing measures 
 we should find a way to give effect to these rights 
 i congratulate madeleine albright on what she has been doing recently in asia 
 we are waiting for the agencies and auditors to have a lot of responsibility for the good reputation of companies and the proper functioning of the market 
 mr president i remember very well the year we have worked together in this house yes there was real optimism about the european idea and a big engagement for a european project and like others here i hope very much that the presidency can bring back a new dynamic let s say give hope to the citizens about your
 we need a clear path and clear deadlines 
 however not all the essential goods are covered for that reason the eu has negotiated this agreement 
 wwf after eighteen years of negotiations at
 and
 the copenhagen summit was a disappointment in many respects 
 this document should be considered therefore as a staple on the road for the total ban of atomic weapons 
 with these initiatives we need much more support and require more focus from all member states this is why the agencies like the european centre for development of vocational training are so important 
 for more than four months elected politicians and civil society leaders have been in prison in pre trial detention for their political activities 
 an agreement will be possible only if we see concrete action and real change in the government legislation 
 we are seeing that the environmental effect of products must be a very important issue in the eu and the whole idea of the ecolabel gives a very useful orientation for consumers of course the ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products the information should be clear and correct

 the house failed to reach an agreement 
 it calls upon the commission and member states to enhance their support to reconciliation to secure peace and stability in ireland and i would therefore urge you colleagues to please support this amendment 
 nevertheless they have been using all legal possibilities to prevent the verwer scenario from happening 
 no that is not true because we have bigger challenges 
 but military interregencies are no excuse for human rights violations reprisals and the government of mozambique has the responsibility to protect its citizens not make them fear for their lives 
 two thousand and eighteen is the year where preparations for the european elections in two thousand and nineteen will be in full swing and we should take this opportunity to inform citizens of their rights and the impacts their vote carries for themselves and for europe as a whole 
 we all know ms ashton as a successful stable country a role model for the whole region 
 for example i think especially now with the current proposal of next mff having in mind that probably the share of financial instruments will even bigger the european investment bank should guarantee a well balanced and geographically balanced distribution of these financial instruments 
 we like to have a hearing on container security on both sides very soon 
 and should these be offensive then they can be tackled via a fourth right debate

 it wants to send strong messages to the iraqi government that the rights of these three thousand four hundred people in ar raf including one thousand women cannot be violated because of the pressure of the mullahs in iran 
 in this debate it is the individual merits of our high representative not her nationality that allows us to celebrate what i do consider to be considerable foreign policy successes the mediation between serbia and kosovo encouraging reforms in burma leading the enormously important diplomacy on iran s nuclear programme and combating the piracy off the horn of africa 
 and now we face the problem where the wipo s export embargo will expire in two weeks 
 this sentiment has been strengthened by widespread corruption and lack of implementation of much needed reforms 
 efficiency is important but we also must spend due
 a cultural shift here in europe from savings to investment is critical 
 we want those countries to choose europe but we also have to bear in mind that europe we want them to choose is not based on dividing lines we are not building an exclusive club here and by bringing ukraine and the others closer to the eu we should also see them as bridge builders it is clear that there is a bargaining game going on between brussels kiev and moscow 
 certain states like my country hungary implement direct aid on the ground for this persecuted community 
 the great innovation union the digital access to all the next generation network and so on 
 this legislative instrument is the first regulation based on the principle of mutual recognition concerning criminal law proceedings

 independently of the adoption of the equalisation regulation the commission confirms that it intends to propose regulation on equal pay for equal work before the end of this year to be mainly based on criteria for sustainable fishing 
 the sharing of our fundamental values and the respect for human rights must be an essential condition in our relations with third countries 
 and national competition authorities but also the report says very clearly that this independence is strongly linked to the availability of the human and financial resources however 
 the country in a hybrid situation when it is not capable of controlling its borders and when it is not willing to get an assistance from the agency which is just an assistance and not a replacement for the work of sovereign nation can also lead to the situation where member countries decide for temporary reasons and for security reasons to introduce also border controls within this country because
 they even planned to shift the election in russia to celebrate occupation of crimea 
 we worked hardest in terms of a definition of energy poverty 
 parliament also appeals to national lawmakers to clearly distinguish high risk or low liquidity assets from those assets which are eligible for use as type covered bonds leaving as a mezzanine credit investment instruments and complementary credits to a new instrument which as i have said would be called european secured notes

 she accepted the fact that citizenship is a national part of the national jurisdiction but she also said that according to the macrist treaty and she is right there has to be a direct link

 and all ireland labour market and cross border access to services are essential to the lives of thousands of eu nationals living in ireland north and south as well as to the overall economy 
 we can t do it if we take a new decision 
 the international community has to admit officially that mass rape in congo is a war crime against humanity 
 these statements have not received any criticisms either inside latvian rule of law or in mainstream media 
 therefore the classification of securitisation special purpose entities as financial counterparties as recently released in a commission draft report seems to contradict and threaten what we have achieved in the securitisation legislation 
 and
 it is time for us to bring some evidence based clarity into this discussion on eu citizens mobility and member states welfare systems instead of allowing the eu s skepticism to band around misleading statistics and inflammatory arguments which are sometimes used by ukip and tory eu sceptics in the uk as a reason for uk leaving the eu last week in the uk newspaper article claim that there are six hundred zero unemployed eu migrants living in the uk 
 our citizens deserve it

 therefore council presidency commissioner i urge you to get your acts together

 the lebanese people are sick and tired of having to be resilient and i understand them 
 it is not required to set out reasons for the decision 
 indeed this agency will not be a silver bullet and it will not solve every issue in european union but we must notice and we must understand that this is a highly important fundamental piece in the larger puzzle of our european union policy 
 it is not business as usual and the american chamber of commerce in moscow is the basis for this agreement 
 you know that we work with the electoral action from 170 completely outdated and i hope that your team and especially you and your colleagues can bring that to a positive result 
 the cotonou agreement with the countries of africa the caribbean and the pacific concerns the union s cooperation with 78 countries 
 i think it is very useful this week to be able to talk about labour mobility in the context of switzerland and norway and iceland all of which are recipients of hugely disproportionate inflows of eu citizens into their economies 
 mr president thank you for your patience and indulgence 
 it is both interesting and demanding to meet the various petitioners who come to the committee on petitions and talk about their problems

 ah you know 
 what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to enable the eu industry to become more competitive 
 the second reason is the interinstitutional equilibrium

 romania it s an american colony 
 russia is not only active in ukraine as we know but also in georgia and it is active in a cyber way in the baltic states so this is the russian policy 
 and of course we have to follow the rules in consensus procedure and to respect the code of conduct procedure of the 65 multiannual programmes 
 furthermore the opinion of afet divides eligible countries into candidate potential candidate neighbour and in exceptional and justified circumstances strategically important countries 
 this could turn out to be a bigger risk than covid 
 it should be and in particular be noted that if the sale process is successful and correctly implemented companies acquiring the shipyard assets will not have to repay the illegal subsidies even if they choose to continue shipbuilding 
 i find that without a central european union agency and a comprehensive and coherent policy the efforts that we are making to improve the situation in developing countries are not a notable

 i call on everyone to conduct the electoral campaign in a decent and tolerant way 
 they cannot be trusted the british legislation is not only a breach of the withdrawal agreement it is a full frontal assault on all aspects of our good friday agreement 
 unfortunately this is just an aspect of a more complex picture that includes several violations of human rights ranging from the well known situation in darfur to international criminal law concerns 
 so i think we should be very cautious in relation to what we do in terms of making any decision to suspend development aid 
 therefore it is high time you come forward with a proposal for a review with an operational separation of the audit and non audit services under a direct eu supervisory
 but can i remind you that an unemployment of 11 million unemployed people and a youth unemployment of 23 million unemployed people and can i remind you that at the d twenty summit with some resistance from some european leaders you accepted that if there is a reason we are willing to do more to engage in having a high economic growth the president of the commission i have twenty seven million good reasons to do more that is why i have an appeal to you today 
 however the focus should be on principles not on specific cases or countries 
 with these mistakes that you guys made we would not be debating this issue here today so what i am asking mr cushley to do is to upscale this strategy to 100 and 200 million and then we will have a european anti poverty strategy for all european citizens 
 again that was not embraced by the council including the uk government 
 even the uk government s own so called balance of competences review shows that foreign policy competences remain squarely with member states and that most of the evidence argues strongly in the uk s interest to work through the eu 
 more than one hundred million of christians suffer from religious persecution 
 amendment three hundred and eighty nine five hundred and twenty one eight hundred and thirty three nine hundred and ninety seven nine hundred and ninety eight nine hundred and ninety nine one thousand sixteen one thousand twenty one one thousand twenty two one thousand twenty three

 we wish to create a living wage index to help define appropriate minimum wages in each member state 
 the world agreed to save its one and only home doing justice to its traditional name gifts from god the marshall islands took action becoming one of the first to ratify the paris agreement 
 the opportunity to repeat the importance of strengthening the parliamentary dimension of the future agreement guaranteeing real consistent power for the future overarching gpa and ensuring that it provides for open democratic and comprehensive parliamentary dialogue

 then we can go further i agree that many things have to be done to improve security and standards of daily life for the truck drivers but the idea of creation of a new agency responsible for road transport is not the right solution 
 however their cases represent only the top of the iceberg as far as putin s reckless repression is concerned marked by violence torture illegal detention and transfer of the chechens to russia this motion recalls the names of many other crimean tatars and other victims and as meps we must remain vigilant and active in upholding these dire
 so it is therefore important for all of us to keep this in mind during future discussions 
 2009 this represents the biggest such contract award brought on by the galileo programme since satellite navigation started keeping international trade flowing is vital for eu and other exports oriented countries despite commitments by the g7 to strengthen trade relations in response to the crisis have increased with the g7 as well as globally 
 i would like to thank you for your very engaged and personal contribution and we want to encourage you to continue as you have just said so that the sectoral presidency will be successful in its second half as it was in the first half 
 she said a privileged group is taking control of the election 
 i think that greece will be enslaved by this financial burden for years to come 
 i do not trust the uk government and eu negotiations 
 i am not here to talk about the war in syria but about the war in libya which started when these warlords failed to take steps when they were needed and in that i see a parallel with the europe our ancestors fought for and the battle we try not to lose right now 
 i believe in democracy and equality of races 
 and again it stanks through the great work of investigation journalists that this scandal is revealed 
 we can even use the experience from a different area of policy the visa regime 
 the citizens against roma is racist too and cannot and should not be tolerated any longer 
 and beware our enemy is now within our very own ranks and is listening as we speak 
 i cite iranian foreign minister zarif no agreement has been reached so we do not have any obligation yet iranian leader ali khamenei nothing has happened yet 
 each year more than eighteen million people receive more than four hundred and forty thousand tonnes of food distributed under this programme

 two thousand and seventeen was the year when we saw the obstacles to result based mobility of the venice commission banks and the first resolution under the eu framework the popular case we have shown further transparency is clearly needed 
 firstly the consumers will have to pay this bill when the low risk loans become more expensive the consumers ordinary european homeowners and the smes relying mainly on mortgage loans 
 we need to build a legislation on data sharing conditions 
 enough pretending that we do not understand who and with whom arms is killing and who is selling weapons even today 
 to reintroduce them now would be completely contradictory to the fisheries reform and the sgp will not support that 
 but despite great ambitions we are not yet at that point 
 i am not saying this is not expenditure this is not spending this is an investment in the future of this union 
 ladies and gentlemen the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of very intensive and i might say sometimes difficult negotiations between the council and parliament 
 but passing laws is not the end of the story for even when child marriage is illegal it is still common 
 mr president thank you for the commission taking some firmative action on this side 
 qualifications are necessary because the board is the one who selects the officers and furthermore watch over their activity in order to report to the shareholders and supervisors 
 these are values which cannot be left just to free flow 
 there are not too many tools for the eu to enforce this agreement if russia does not fulfil its commitments therefore this agreement should be seen as a temporary solution until its replacement by a legally binding agreement included in the new partnership and cooperation agreement 
 as those two had i believe in equal treatment and we can deal with an opinion 
 if you do not make this into a beauty contest about whose more or less ambitious realistic or less realistic or more or less willing to pay we need four clarities because too much is at stake we need a clear and ambitious political stance 
 of course if it is not possible for nato to act for whatever political reason we should be able to act ourselves 
 and we better unite next time and that is one voice 
 but when i read the franco spanish maghrebian letter i saw the same old tired repetition of our positions and preferences which have so far singly failed to prompt israeli government action of any sort 
 i think that this debate shows that we are going hand in hand in the same direction 
 in this respect i would like to highlight three key issues 
 i let let everybody speak a little bit longer if you don t mind i don t open this procedure up because we are running late 
 tracing me because i was one of the finalists of the presidential elections in

 russia has always been a very proud nation with rich culture with inventions with an expertise 
 there are errors in four amendments which need to be corrected 
 i do not really understand how the brits will continue to try to convince trading partners on the sustainability issue because we can only convince our partners if we have the weight of the whole european union with 500 million
 and freedom of speech is
 i would like to see an eu china pact for africa various colleagues have mentioned it not to exploit the resources of this continent but to develop it and to serve the basic needs of the people in africa 
 i hope that this will be completed in the foreseeable future that means maybe two or three months 
 one could even execute a transfer just within a few hours around the globe for a very fixed and clear price of six 
 these provisions ensure barrier free journeys for everyone and will fundamentally improve the lives of disabled people so please fellow members vote for the trant and the greens amendments tomorrow 
 how can we ensure that member states deliver on their targets 
 that the commitment to democratic reform of ukraine moldova and georgia and other members is not lost in this bargaining process if we want to talk in terms of choices there should be no other choice for the eastern neighbours but moving resolutely towards the rule of law freedom and democracy 
 we need to take a quick decision if we want to follow the normal procedure i would urge the council to withdraw their legal base accept the commission s legal base
 they are more or less in the same position but in the environment
 i ve seen myself at made in squares with big guns in my hands but the guns were that big that they were bigger than my hands itself so nobody you should say it s nonsense but people believe it 
 mr president then there are two amendments on existing pilot projects that must be withdrawn and replaced with amendments to create new preparatory action lines 
 however i believe that in our debate and in everything that we do with afghanistan we have to be very careful how we approach things because afghanistan is a country that comes through a violent repressive religious dictatorship 
 opinion on the possible changes
 are working on their own central bank digital currency and at the end of the day the conclusion is not if there will be digital currencies in the future but who will issue and control them 
 mr president i want to focus on two specific areas of this very broad ranging report on organised crime in the eu 
 and
 filters are out on the first amendments so there is no censorship there is no filtering and political censorship is really a very different thing 
 if we look into what happened to china after it joined the wto we can see that the growth and the success story of china really began with that date a few years ago 
 his house parliament knows how difficult and how intractable the situation
 in these chaos the european commission within its competences has quickly responded in the framework of crisis and civil protection mechanisms in the eu and worldwide 
 it distinguishes the two main dusieres human rights abused by the current government and the iranian nuclear program 
 and so does the rhetoric of world leaders when appropriate and when attending climate change conferences 
 we spoke to his wife this morning 
 we also don t need to leave the back doors open to for the retreat and to go back to the business as usual with russia just because we can find some excuses to do this 
 they should be nurtured and supported by all of us 
 we have to ensure access for all to loans savings microfinance and more that will allow people to improve their livelihoods

 there is only a slow progress 
 the principle of free movement does not include supporting or rejecting
 the current legal framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide real solutions to the bookshelf problem that visually impaired still live 
 there are also a few shortcomings 
 there is no such medical technique or treatment which could permit us to cross this internationally agreed principle of non modification of human germ line 
 with full respect to our national cultures we can build the pillars of our common cultural architecture for the years to come i am sure that many events that will be happening throughout the year will successfully spread this message in this context 
 if bafd does not do its job germany will lose its reputation in the financial world and investors will lose confidence 
 iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of ashraf residents parliamentary delegations human rights organisations lawyers and journalists and even doctors to the camp and do not allow many logistical materials to get into ashraf 
 i agree with you so i think the urgency that was stressed in many of the contributions is really the urgency with which we should look for the result 
 another thing we can have simplified audit swaps well introducing more simplified approach and removing unnecessary requirements 
 the european union parliament in full feeling their responsibilities is entitled to receive the necessary support from the community and the local authorities whose efforts to meet their obligation unfortunate of
 let s give our citizens the opportunity to choose a transnationalist giving people their right to choose this is democracy 
 the adoption of the resolution as he said will make his mission close to impossible 
 i think there is still a long way to go eliminating discards for example and there are times when the commission still seems to veer towards market regulation at least in its original version i have often said that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker it takes a considerable time to turn round and i do believe that the controlled regulation will go a long way to achieving the necessary playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned just as the development of regional planning for fisheries has not yet been fully realised so too the control regulation will go a long way
 mr president thank you for allowing me to put this very simple question 
 this amendment by the socialists has nothing to do with the lack of payment appropriations 
 i really hope through your vote tomorrow you will give us your support not to lose any of these achievements 
 more rules and regulation will not improve this situation 
 we should not be a platform for examination debate and most of all for solutions but it is not the european union s function to be both judge and jury in this matter 
 this preferential treatment is only justified if the collateral quality is high so as the first factor that i have mentioned is indeed satisfied 
 fill that this house is better than and doesn t accept 
 in my opinion the proposed limits are acceptable given the risk and the long term effect cyanide radiation has on the health 
 the court will remain doing its best when responding to the needs of the european taxpayers owning them on the quality of the eu spending finally respect to the commission and the council for their acceptance of our accession and their enthusiasm today about streamlining and simplifying the future spending schemes 
 but we should not take away the right of free speech and this issue even if i don t agree at all what he has to say 
 a lot can be done to take this fight to the next level 
 it is a signal that trust in this utterly overrated president in a government that repeatedly announces his will to extinguish israel

 we should have access to the biggest market on the planet 
 it is external aggression and the internal disintegration of the country that are the main causes of the present crisis in the country 
 the commissioner the liberty committee voted on an oral question to be addressed to the commission the liberty committee is concerned about the absence so far of any initiative by the commission related to the establishment of a voluntary permanent eradication scheme 
 how can we plan a common military or civilian mission if there is no shared assessment of the situation on the ground 
 and the digital euro is the best answer to private initiatives such as libra let s take a look at our global neighbours china japan or switzerland 
 i know it is very much a challenge but i would like the european parliament to lead on this very topic and not to follow we have seen that all the developments on the internet are taking a very high and very rapid flight 
 another important consultation for the epp group has always been the independence of the commission s impact assessment
 if we want dignity and stability we need to invest in respect for human rights also by our companies instead of in arms and defence we also saw the tragic pictures of the attack in lahore 
 having returned from azerbaijan i come to this chamber with the perception that the north koreans are at last willing to discuss denuclearisation starting with a freeze

 the council supports this activity and would welcome other forms of support to member states in the area of detention conditions and facilities

 we are here to find the best solution to save the planet and not to find the best compromise with our companies 
 mr president vice president i am very happy that the council also focused on the digital sector which is absolutely crucial if we want to live in freedom and democracy in the future because today this way of living is unvoluntarily threatened by the business model of a few global tech giants 
 their reliance on the national service law which is in fact modern slavery ensures a fearful and compliant population their intimidation of any opposition including deadly force should be no longer tolerated erdoğan s foreign policy such as it is serves to destabilise already desperate regions

 i therefore commend the effort shown by this parliament to encourage understanding and rebuild trust and confidence in these instruments i am pleased that we have managed to bring this report closer to international standards and ensure that the eu is not placed at a competitive disadvantage globally 
 such decisions must be followed by actions with appropriate budget 
 one the words others than the united states should be deleted from the heading and the remarks as decided by the committee on budgets 
 the reason repeatedly given is that the eu does not have the data for individual member states and for that reason will not even attempt to give me an estimate as i said the eu has gained from our fishing grounds an indisputable right to even give an estimate of that value from all data that they do have is not acceptable 
 we can tackle climate change and halve our emissions and have cleaner air 
 yet now that we are closer than ever to realising this goal disparaging voices arise across europe 
 today we call on the republic of the philippines to cease immediately all violence and human rights abuses 
 it is the way you look at it but the regulation establishing the financial instrument for the development cooperation which is so important and which we take a lot of pride in does not contain any explicit reference to the possibility of suspending assistance to third countries in cases where a beneficiary country fails to observe the basic human rights principles 
 unfortunately our economists will still suffer for quite a while not least because of the public budgets and probably future inflationary effects of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess 
 some stroke examples have emerged this week of children being possibly traded and even abused 
 it is ethically and legally unacceptable to permit creation of embryos with dna from three parents 
 we also have an internal problem 
 and
 by saying this i am not saying that we can shift the focus from fraud prevention to something else but we could have another priority which is well for example a full fledged audit reform 
 let me however emphasise that nobody objected to the contents which is a merely technical update of the figures for 2013 and 2014 resources via the amendments rebased
 let s make europe a better and safer place for ordinary people not for criminals 
 it is a very important achievement now it is the time to move on with the implementation of the pillar principles
