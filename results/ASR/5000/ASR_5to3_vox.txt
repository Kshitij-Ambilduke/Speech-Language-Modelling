 the commission is aware of the concerns expressed by the european parliament and the council regarding the lack of transparency in the process of the selection of the new executive director of the european medicines agency 
 in all of this the commission will continue to support the efforts of the member states to ensure that the eu is a safe and secure place to live work and travel in and that we are all better protected from terrorism and crime 
 i am hopeful that the european parliament will support the commission s proposal to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of animals in the production of cosmetics

 how could you imagine that the european union would be able to do more than what it is doing 
 i think we have to be very careful 
 i think that the commission is right to say that the european union is a global player and that it is important to have a global approach to the issue of climate change

 otherwise we will be

 conversion and derogation are the two main tools that the commission has at its disposal to ensure that the eu s legislation is up to date and that it is applied correctly

 the eu should not be a party to the agreement but it should be a party to the implementation of the agreement the eu should be a party to the implementation of the agreement and the eu should be a party to the implementation of the agreement 
 in reality the upheaval in the middle east and north africa is a result of the failure of the arab spring to deliver the democratic and economic reforms that people were demanding 
 for example the commission is currently working on a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting which will be presented in the first half of 2013 
 my point is that the european union is not a super state 
 in our group we have a very good balance between the different political groups and i think that is a good thing 
 why georgia why now why is this important 
 the article on the right to education is a very important one and i am glad that the commission has taken the initiative to propose a directive on the right to education

 i m sure you re familiar with the story of the little pig who built his house out of straw 
 fundamental rights are not an obstacle to the fight against terrorism they are the very foundation of our democratic societies and the basis of our fight against terrorism 
 the next step is to ensure that the european union is able to take the necessary measures to protect its citizens and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market 
 that s the devastating impact of the pandemic on the world s poorest people and it s a crisis that s only going to get worse as the virus spreads

 we can find different ways of doing this but i think that the most important thing is to make sure that we have a strong and effective european union that can act in the world and that can act in the world in a way that is consistent with the values that we have 
 is there to be a vote 
 let us prove that we are serious about our commitments and that we are ready to act

 we are in favour of the commission s proposal to extend the scope of the regulation to include the use of the internet and mobile phones but we are not in favour of the commission s proposal to extend the scope of the regulation to include the use of the internet and mobile phones 
 it allows the commission to take action in the event of a serious threat to the rule of law in a member state and i believe that this is the right way forward 
 mr president after the events of the last few days the european union has to take a clear and united stance on the situation in ukraine 
 and that means that in the future the european union will be able to take action against member states that do not comply with the rules of the european union that is why the european union has to be able to act against member states that do not comply with the rules of the european union

 on the basis of the commission s analysis the commission will propose a new set of measures to address the identified shortcomings 
 any decent person would be horrified by the idea of a child being raped but we cannot allow the horror of the crime to blind us to the fact that the child is a victim and that we need to protect the child 
 these people have been subjected to horrific violence and abuse and the eu must do everything in its power to help them 
 the gafa companies are not only the largest and most powerful companies in the world but they are also the most powerful companies in the world

 if you want to be taken seriously you should not be using the same arguments as the commission 
 and the society of the time was very much against the idea of women being educated 
 yet it is their own fault that they are in this situation 
 we look at this and we see that the european union is not a union of states but a union of peoples and we see that we have to be more united than ever before we see that we have to be more united than ever before 
 indeed the ftt will be a tax on the financial sector and it will be a tax on the real economy the ftt will be a tax on the financial sector and it will be a tax on the real economy 
 the commission is committed to ensuring that the eu s financial assistance is used in the most effective way possible

 the commission will continue to monitor the situation and will take further action if necessary

 despite the fact that the european union has been a strong supporter of the peace process 
 the current legal framework for the protection of personal data is based on the principle of proportionality we need to ensure that the measures we take are proportionate to the risks that we are trying to address 
 it is simply not acceptable that the european union is the only international organisation that does not have a human rights sanctions regime 
 naturally getting the right balance between the need to protect the environment and the need to keep our economies going is not easy 
 it goes without saying that the european union will continue to support the efforts of the un and the african union to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in mali 
 we need to stop the current trend of increasing the number of people who are unemployed and who are at risk of poverty 
 we have invested in the development of the european neighbourhood policy and the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and we have invested in the development of the eastern partnership and

 the commission will continue to monitor the situation and will take further action if necessary 
 but volunteering is not only about the volunteers themselves 
 the commission will continue to monitor the situation and will take further action if necessary 
 one of the main reasons for the delay is that the commission has been waiting for the european parliament to give its consent to the commission s proposal to amend the regulation on the european border and coast guard agency 
 we shouldn t have to fight for it 
 in addition the commission will continue to monitor the situation in the member states and to take action where necessary including by means of infringement procedures 
 for example we are working on a proposal to improve the functioning of the european union agency for asylum which will be presented in the coming weeks 
 and i fear that the european union is not doing enough to protect the rights of the lgbti community in the world and i fear that the european union is not doing enough to protect the rights of the lgbti community in the world 
 this is a trade agreement that is good for the eu and good for the us and i hope that the us will be able to ratify it as soon as possible

 the british government has said that it will not allow the european union to dictate to the british people what they can and cannot do in their own country 
 i think that the commission has done a very good job in the way it has presented this proposal 
 that the brave men and women of the armed forces of the united states have died in the defense of freedom and democracy around the world 
 what is now needed is a strong and united response from the international community to the crisis in the region
