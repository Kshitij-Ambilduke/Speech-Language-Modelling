 imposition of switching of the life support treatment is nothing else than euthanasia 
 for the first time the eu s best political prisoner andrei sannikov and civil society leader sergei fyodorov are finally and humanely released but for chodorkovsky and lebedev he has been the greatest source of inspiration in their painful struggle for democracy in the communist regime 
 the common tragedy of europe however does not allow for free movement of eu nationals 
 the commission has taken strong action before
 there will be clear rights for travellers when something goes wrong and the travel industry will be entitled to extend travel rights at least 10 days will be entitled to extension for at least 3 days if the return journey cannot be carried out on time because of a natural disaster 
 2012 finally we would also urge the commission to make a greater use of the structured dialogue with in the framework of the european social fund as a way of promoting equality between men and women 
 we can do progress only if european project is supported by european citizens in all member states 
 it is outrageous to see a government in the european union using the police and the secret service to intimidate political opponents and false allegations 
 and
 i watched in close up a legislative system that permits anonymous bureaucrats to generate so called law without any regard for the damage they do to the british economy and its businesses 
 we will lose primary forest all around the world in a vain attempt to manage them sustainably 
 we found that millions of legitimate jobs for our citizens have been lost that billions of taxpayers money are not being paid and above all how much our governments could appreciate those
 not there will be a big crisis between you and the european parliament 
 we must also strongly condemn the loss of civilians by the houthis the gulf of aden the kingdom of saudi arabia and the use of cia drones 
 but to be honest we have to do more 
 thank you mr president much of the european council s discussion this weekend as a pro remainer of the highest newscaster standards 
 the difficulty was not clear and we could not make it very beginning that we would have a greater europeanisation in this area 
 we know that they read on their commutes 
 we have to go and ask for the saudi arabia deal for the sector because we have seen that no sector could solve the problem and we have to solve for saudi arabia because bp is a european company 
 2012 while i respect one country s system i find it shocking that a country running a communist party appears to be advocating a system which brings representation only to those with wealth and privilege 
 the sovereignty of iraq is at stake and we should place our trust in this democratic elected government of iraq 
 by working together by acting together we are
 but to do so they expect member states to have in place a commission we now have in the commission a contractual evaluation and member states like uk germany italy are already going to join 
 ah duff for instance right now may want to put a question to me about what i said and i would let him do so for thirty seconds under this rule if it is adopted 
 in the recent years this country has been unfairly treated by the eu and by the international community 
 the social use of these criminalisations for youth support regulations or even crime prevention could really help in powering these communities 
 finally i hope that the commission will support parliament s proposal to include parliaments participation in this time 
 we need to find urgent solutions to get the aid to the people and to reduce the level of suffering of the people 
 our economic model goes towards sustainable model and creates jobs 
 it will serve to create the democratic deficit between the people and the european union notably in the european union institutions and it gives the citizens a platform to express and propose ideas for european legislation 
 the very idea of the eu is to unite the peoples of the continent and reinforce the fact that they are willing to discuss debate negotiate and to deal with each other in the cause of peace if peace can disappear like a puff of smoke if we are too much of a puppet for so much of smoke 
 new and ppmpes are continuing to be localized in the countries and the counter terrorism and counter extremism will be linked in between only twenty three countries and only from the eastern and balkan areas 
 so it s time for james 
 but choose to leave the country for better jobs 
 well in europe we face a major danger but is uncontrolled and is escalating fast 
 and
 don t sign the joint declaration 
 live in the eu and the eea 
 a government that has shown its disrespect for the most of our values for almost four decades 
 and we also call for consultation with independent experts when the maximum level needs to be reviewed 
 moreover i think not just the geographical balance but the distribution of financial instruments towards the different sectors of our economy is crucial 
 this new regulation will bring in a new regulation for benefits for the european citizens this is the signature of the prime minister of the united kingdom theresa may and i am pleased that such an important point has been agreed upon 
 and i m like 
 i think we have to have a lesson to continue to face the long term challenge of the post agreement era by diversifying our sources and technologies 
 2016 we need to achieve that but we are opposing and fighting against these steps even in this very house 
 that is also in the defence of our interests but again let s try to get on one line with nato that is the best option 
 we call on boris johnson to be active and to put human rights and democracy first instead of having a good diplomatic relationship with the dictatorship and signing business deals with dictators 
 such disasters in crisis cannot be resolved without cooperation and reliance on national capacities member states especially smaller ones cannot afford to maintain high end disaster and large reserves in times of crisis 
 there is so much left to do 
 the eu should become more flexible and optimistic 
 i would like to add to the calls for this proposal to be drawn up and for the commission to submit a new one with a different legal basis 
 the european union is a long journey and years after we are finally having this debate i am glad that we are finally having this debate about economic and social issues and i would like to thank all my colleagues who contributed to the resolution 
 the eea laying down maximum levels as well as the radioactive substances is concerned will be reviewed as and when new scientific data becomes available 
 the recommendations of the european parliament and numerous other institutional organisations have been completely ignored 
 i can mention two figures here 
 i m just back from the philippines and we have to support our european fishermen not to leave it to hollywood and bollywood 
 but the rule of law cannot be observed selectively 
 so in disregard of if the law is in this case mr salvi is partly right 
 we are obliged to protect social security and everything that we can protect the welfare the protection the rights the unemployed the poor the weak the disabled the elderly those who cannot protect themselves 
 200 000 to 500 000 the unfortunate 400 000 are a very high number of health professionals four hundred thousand and nurses six hundred and thirty seven thousand are a very high number of doctors and nurses 
 firefighters from many european countries to contain the emergency 
 firstly on the issue of the european union s continued support for democracy in the philippines according to the press seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more seconding more is not part of the peace process but an aggressor is agressor 
 they will seek to destroy the european union to drive down wages and conditions to undermine the environment and in britain both in the eu and in britain i urge the european council to hold firm in rejecting british proposals in a number of international law and in defending the interests of ireland and the eu 
 just to say once again it is the youngest nation in europe and we are not so rich in young people in the interest of the continent 
 therefore i would like to kindly ask you mr president to address the issue because preserving language diversity is a european value and the right for minorities is a basic human right 
 if serious about climate change the copenhagen conference should speak up their commitments on meaningful and binding targets for c o two reduction 
 and
 it worries me a bit that the commission calls these indicators 
 we are supporting the supply side and it is difficult to create a demand in the own domestic structure especially in innovation because it was not included in the investment for growth and jobs package 
 like iceland this house can still fill this void by supporting their false narrative that using social media tools that young people communicate through a false impression that they join a good cause against the oppressive regime 
 we want to be non biased we want to be neutral and we need to look at it in a very accurate way indeed the previous debate clearly demonstrates we have to draw the right lessons 
 while the united states spends trillions of dollars on security europe is slow or idle in developing our own strategy 
 it is obvious that by forces that was killed by forces that oppressed hated and hated in russia 
 clearly if we have surplus of medical capacity this is not going to be enough and for that reason we are doing two more things 
 there is also a straight forward message reduction policy which is the demand for low cost for low income and the sms is supplied at subsidized price 
 it means as much to them as it means to me 
 lgbti people s presence can scare a succession of investors at this summit and i hope that commissioner füle has kept a good diary so that he can publish an interesting memoir
 i call for deep knowledge of the most recent history of europe 
 in my view in my view it is not a good system but that s the current rule 
 i believe that it is in our interest that international law is kept which means the territorial integrity of a country and the sovereignty of a country 
 we managed to obtain a reference to the chapter on mental protection and the change in the legal basis from the treaty on the functioning of the european union to the treaty on the functioning of the european union 
 many many young people out of work when they could be working and shaping this sort of thing 
 the commission invites parliament in the upcoming review of the european parliament to open this matter on the access which really concerns to justice in europe and the enforcement of rights granted by european union law 
 it is about time we decided the endless cheap chase after cheap food and ever higher yields must end 
 mr president we have witnessed a surge of young people travelling to join isis many of whom are born and raised in the european countries 
 well i did not hear a real question but of course we agree there are no
 it is a very important contribution to the european semester political and security aspects of our collective
 when working on the rulings for the financial sector we have to know that fintech stands for faster cheaper consumer friendly and much more convenient financial services that are enabled by technology 
 this measuring in inches is to calculate its internal problems 
 my intention now is to go to nuremberg in my private capacity to listen in the pursuit of a peaceful regime to help the eu
 at the present moment there is no more important global issue than the preservation of peace 
 in this case the industry will need to rethink its export markets and possibly the features of its products 
 all parties must attend the negotiations meeting 
 our people and our economies are
 today our parliament is paying especial attention to the actual situation by adopting a resolution only on
 i would like to stress that the abolition of the export of equipment for the realisation of capital punishment in the commission does not mean that the commission does not see the mere removal of a mere formal requirement as a step forward in the mutual trust in each other s judicial system 
 digital europe is not an option 
 however we are still considering tonight after this debate and to morrow after our votes it can be significantly influenced and changed by the outcome of the european council this week 
 the eu has estimated that one hundred and twenty five million european union citizens live in energy poverty and we know that energy policy disproportionately affects our most vulnerable people 
 when will the high representative and the commissioner condemn the palestinian stabbings of israeli civilians 
 the trade package where developing countries exporting cotton to the eu and buying manufactured products from industry have to change countries 
 they are suffering because of the euro their suffering because of an eu project that was not prepared to stand in for greece and to protect the democratic rights of the greek people 
 it is self evident that italy must comply with eu law as any other member state 
 recently though i ve been able to assure people that the policy has undergone significant change 
 secondly the report urges the review of existing conditions of the existing convention on the protection of the environment and biodiversity 
 the existing corporation in the fields of energy and energy efficiency is a good start for further cooperation 
 however the way to a european single market for mobility which has to be our ultimate goal is still far from being reached 
 in recent years we have significantly improved the fight against money laundering in estonia 
 new capital flows will lead to higher capital costs for banks and mortgage banks heavily involved in low risk lending 
 our words have to be in line with the numbers are provided in the budget 
 this new regulation is an example of how the european union can bring concrete benefits to its citizens 
 i think we all agree on the crucial fact that all eu member states must deliver on gender equality and women s empowerment 
 the commission issued in this file was obviously the right approach but the implementation of the eu investment plan is a process 
 mr president in spending your last days in office i am asking you do we really accept that eu governments pressurise political detention through arbitrary detention 
 when we look at the labour market then one third of jobs will be deeply influenced by this transformation 
 secondly it is very disappointing that the council has once again made unnecessary cuts to the programmes in the area of citizenship 
 underlines that in order to be transferred to democratic civilian authority syria s autocratic as soon as possible 
 we have to deliver added value for our societies 
 what the commission has said in these respects has been very welcome and i hope for great support for this excellent report 
 should the commission decide that action is required and present a proposal the council will of course give it the importance it justly gives the importance of the issues 
 how is it possible that today when we discuss our era as one of the most fundamental values of life value and human dignity that the united kingdom does not act in the best interests of its citizens citizens of its own citizens 
 they cannot go to school 
 part of that calculation is sale by destination that cannot be determined beforehand so there is real uncertainty for those companies and i think that acts as a disincentive for foreign direct investment 
 they are the singers the musicians and the journalists 
 rights of the child and the rights of the child to be protected the rights of the child to be protected which would allow the majority of the european union to remain within the european union and the rights of the child to be protected which would allow the majority of the european union to remain within the european union 
 in 2015 the leaders of the eu agreed on a declaration that highlights the importance of ocean science 
 i respect him in timing this speech because we here in europe are lacking in addressing the issues of lack of democracy rule of law and human rights in russia 
 mr president on behalf of my group the ecr i salute the new commission and i hope that all of us here in the plenary will work for the success of this commission 
 it will follow closely the development of the contamination proceedings by the commission with this green paper 
 it will save also time and stress of all europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries 
 freedom of expression is the cornerstone of the market 
 instead of speaking about more defence let s stick to the european tradition of promoting human rights also through radical democratic treaties 
 and
 so in the containers so in the containers which are never even touched come slaves count good drugs 
 ah u s is a sovereign country and only accountable to its citizens 
 first two thousand and nineteen is not only the year of the european elections but it also could be the first year after the withdrawal of the united kingdom therefore it is of paramount importance to keep the communication with european citizens open we have to increase our efforts to engage our efforts to engage them 
 this motion calls for our joint solidarity with the people of the crimea especially the local tatar community whose members and leaders are being targeted and repressed in repressive and vindictive measures similarly to the free press 
 you have warned of severe consequences 
 only this could help eritrea and the region with
 how are we going to measure whether the influx is high enough is it high enough when it s all over the european union whether it wants to decide or not 
 and again we have to be tough because as we have to know there is no alternative for them to withdraw from ukraine to give up crimea and to engage with us in a normal way and i hope that ukraine is at our side 
 so we better have a plan 
 human rights security is more important than ever 
 the economic burden of these diseases is putting pressure on the member states and the costly significantly increased with the progression of the disease 
 it is really bad and low business for europe 
 secondly the european union should use the enhanced cooperation as a platform to promote improved relations between kosovo and other countries of the region and other countries of central and eastern europe furthermore it is crucial that the eu continues to maintain pressure in central asia in particular in kazakhstan 
 this is a fallacious circle the more arms people buy the more attacks by the more attacks 
 the message is that the eu does not have any new solutions 
 it also takes a big step forward in terms of promoting female entrepreneurship 
 travel businesses will also benefit from the new directive 
 but based on our social and environmental standards 
 this is automatic exchange of information 
 the european arrest warrant has moreover proved its worth to promote fast and coordinated exchanges of information and other activities related to the european arrest warrant 
 we will compete for an equitable and sustainable society of shared prosperity and dignity 
 so what is the purpose of all this 
 in moldova the negotiations for an association and free trade agreement were recently and recently the country has overturned the gay propaganda ban which discriminates from its own eastern neighbour 
 some member states understand psychiatry only as the procurement of harrowing and it is much more than that 
 it is also central to our legislation at least 50 of the total funding under the european social fund and social investment for europe through the european social fund 
 i think it s very clear that this mechanism should be fit for all member states and from time to time we will check everything in all member states 
 although the situation in the mediterranean is a very difficult and challenging one leading to europe s external borders and social inclusion for all citizens it is still not sufficiently developed in our union 
 i will willingly act in favour of the social dimension to be included in the eu s competences as proposed 
 one example of the work of the ombudsman that can be used to have a smart specialisation approach
 and
 if we look at security threats i also understand that from washington dc a threat from russia is different than if you look from kiev from kyiv or from georgia or from yerevan that s a different way of looking at it 
 i particularly welcome the opening of a dialogue or the matter of cooperation of the system of co finance for european projects 
 smell trouble before the rest of the world is to see 
 however thirty years ago today mrs margaret thatcher was elected as british prime minister and she faced similar socialist problems to those that we face today crippling debts crippling unemployment rising taxes and public unrest she understood the solution was small government individual freedom and national self determination 
 it has also recently been revealed that there are approximately 10 000 brits currently drawing on employment benefit so it does work both ways 
 i d together with the declaration of the members of this house visited camp moria in october last year and met with american iraqi and yazidi officials there 
 let us be clear the only liberal democracy in the middle east will never be a bigger problem than the evil dictatorships and terror groups in the surrounding region 
 we have all known about these important landmarks in russian history but
 the commission will continue working with you as one of our principal partners 
 i believe this will be proven to be the most cost effective way to meet the eu s air quality standards 
 the key achievement is russia s commitment not to impose new or additional duties 
 and the digital finance report is a good basis 
 the european parliament the council and the commission have committed to the citizens market and small operators 
 the commission has not disregarded that 
 we have sanctions they should be continued but is also possible if russia goes on this way that we increase these sanctions and have more smart sanctions against russia 
 we need the focus on deepening and strengthening the internal market to make sure that all single market strategies are completed by 2012 especially of course the tech single market 
 that set and given the absence of relevant provision in the council decision has no further power to take action in the area mentioned by the honourable members 
 the compromise also includes clear rules to define which member states have jurisdiction and the cooperation with the member states concerned as well as the need for cross border cases to involve european judges thank you for your work and please do support this 
 vassilisa is the meeting which is not procedural 
 we all know at this stage that in the past amending budget is actually needed and should therefore be adopted without delay 
 an active and effective european union contributes to the overall security of the european union 
 therefore there is a lot of work ahead of us 
 mr president the commission thinks that democracy works in a nation state but you know the european union for decades now proves that there is a very good combination of local regional and national democracy and that is what i will defend because that is the future 
 we clearly state that this is not meant for the small companies but the fp7 statute is available for all companies 
 we are democrats and we support the right of kosovo to be an independent state recognised by most of the states in the international community 
 this is a good start and i call on all stakeholders involved to improve the synergies in the next programming period so that all this nice talk can actually become a reality 
 as if it had given up not only on solving the underlying conflict but also on abhorring and increasingly frustrating syria s
 we are convinced that it is very useful for the quality of the funding programmes it is based on a new focus on results on the needs of recipients 
 we are afraid to speak out to express our dismay as a cultural practice and our social services in england the police the politicians the police do not speak up for fear of being labelled racist 
 but very bluntly the people of this planet must destroy capitalism before capitalism destroys our planet 
 now is the time to implement the decisions taken for example the pesco projects 
 but to do this we also need to be firm with the caribbean and tell them that they need to implement their reforms 
 i hope this will be covered by the universal service directive which will come in the second half of the year 
 the global society must act now 
 fighting against and addressing the causes of this disease requires long term comprehensive and sustained efforts 
 and perhaps since he is let a little bit more of the hook that he can also adjust his government policy in two ways one really and truly listen to the needs of the greeks who are suffering 
 ah percentage there are very large disparities between the youth employment rates in different regions 
 this year the european parliament has already shown its readiness to give up the british government in sixteen out of nineteen areas of european policy despite the fact that in over one hundred and eighty days during the last year there has even been minor divergence between eu and uk goals 
 i hear that the intention is to have a message and i hear that you intend to do something to help those who suffer most 
 the member states must keep up the pressure and not slip into partisan political in fighting russia s pressures on our eastern partners and our eastern partners pressures on one another must be resisted at all costs 
 beyond the capacity of sceptics ah by themselves 
 as we have heard parliament and european commission are working for their interests on their behalf 
 i especially oppose defining the level of minimum wages for domestic workers which i think should remain in the jurisdiction of national decision making 
 the eu and the member states need to increase their efforts to prevent and combat the abuse and trafficking of children and to develop specific programmes and financial support to strengthen work in this area 
 we will not need to put the money into the budget like the uk we will not need to put the money into the budget like the uk we will not need to put the money into the budget like the uk we will not need to put the money into the budget like the uk we will not need to put the money into the budget like the uk but also if you want fresh money you can tell me that in the next few months you may have to invest more into the budget 
 on 14 june the council adopted a package of restoration use conservation use trade look for traps and we can t say connected with the olive oil 
 ah fifteen as a rule interconnections are absent in those member states where natural gas is dominated by an incumbent operator 
 substantial support and close bilateral cooperation is needed for the complete and complete european union transposition of the treaty 
 is the real power of the country with tonnes of soldiers and weapons 
 this cooperation requires our
 and on the question of freedom of speech i think if we have an unlimited concept of freedom of speech that s very nearer liberal than only the bigger ones 
 the proportion of products purchased in the market in relation to the total volume of the plan must reflect their exact
 and then 
 i believe that i speak on behalf of many of us when i say that this notion is mute 
 we should be proud of that that is the merit of the countries joining the eu the team of those who are supporting in your words the can do mentality 
 our people and our economies are tied 
 there is only one c o two before paragraph 3 so pressure is mounting on all on track preparing for our next meeting 
 actually it has been functioning at the expense of those taxpayers who despite of economic and financial crisis survive in the fierce global competition 
 this and so much more is the reality of the repressive discourse and illegal actions of the israeli state when what we need is true equality for all regardless of the people of the middle east 
 will you take action at last if not when 
 what is the reason for this 
 we need to respect the views of investors to the viktor orbán network and we need to allow investors to flexibly gain access to the spectrum and enter the market 
 the family of the victims and the iraqi government cannot forget this fact and the iraqi constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the faylaq or the pkk on iraqi soil 
 in the last ten years i have heard many czechs including the late civic forum imploring the level of a level playing field inadequate holding of economic and environmental standards and too much imitative of the czechs by way of mimicry from the centre 
 and
 it is difficult to not feel a sense of double standards or inequity in the european union let us talk about equality when it comes to the access to the shelving to the shelves or double standards concerning the composition of food products in different member states 
 2014 the development framework for the energy market and for the efficient functioning of the energy market is i believe of course dependent on the implementation of this package and my colleague commissioner moog has just said that the fourth package is the solution 
 we reached a dramatic drop on the price of the euro from the commission proposal by the commission the most important was the price on the diesel 
 there is a need of a concerted response to maintain pressure on the principal rape and torture sites and to bring them to justice on the international criminal court 
 i can also remember her saying no no no the eu is not under or doesn t understand 
 it is important that member states have joined the coalition in fighting against isis 
 many stakeholders have been consulted over the past years and their partnership has been completely evaluated 
 he played a key role in the peace deal and this should continue 
 it is sinister that after such an attack arms sales in the uk go up for self defence 
 it must be reminded that democracy is one of the goals of the eastern partnership and as a part of this initiative 
 and it s to take some technical measures and things will come down by themselves and we must say some sad words to the people who will be hit 
 now that is in brief of the rules of procedure where is clearly stated how speaking times should be allocated 
 and
 why the union in particular should work hard to finalise the legal text so that they can be signed as soon as possible 
 by their slogans they clearly said that they are not interested on any of the ruling factions of this regime and they rejected
 let s come back to the core reason of the treaty 
 we both believe in solidarity in addressing the root causes and let me thank you for having opened its doors to many many refugees from the sahel when the eu flew from their countries fleeing from their countries 
 democracy your nation was so admired for its fighting for
 in this regard the strategic review of the eeas communicates the need of which europe holds presence in the 16th 17th 18th 19th and 20th century as the only truly connecting europe and european union 
 now i started this initiative in january this year and two hundred and forty six members signed this but this will again if you don t put it on this week 
 it calls upon the commission and the member states to connect and support further towards developing peace and conflict prevention and recovery and calls the worldwide information and communication technology broadband agenda while acknowledging the unprecedented challenges and pressures on the united nations system while pressing for the united nations to be more effective 
 however a vibrant democracy also needs a competitive and constructive opposition and that also i would say our belief that there are at least challenges for the opposition 
 time has come not to accept new demarcation lines between those who have been members of the european union for many years and those who came to the european union with a promise that this would be better time for ordinary people 
 it is no wonder when so many drugs are needed when three hundred million animals live their whole lives in cages in the eu perhaps only feeding the sun on their backs for the first time for the first time on the breeze on the wind on the sun many never feeling grass beneath their feet 
 the cost of hiv and aids tb and hcv medicines for treatment and prevention varies from one country to another 
 it provides a detailed list of human rights and democratic principles that the parties must comply with in fulfilling the agreement the negotiations must be launched by august this year and
 i look forward to your answer and thank you very much for attention 
 the right to access eu programmes and help across the eu and the right to be represented in this parliament 
 but it was the country itself being more capable 
 2014 the commission will submit a legislative proposal on the modernisation of the financial framework for the period 2014 2020 
 new and old solutions could finally be debated and fully adopted and implemented 
 a clear commitment 
 the commission has recently adopted their 2012 plan in order to give the participating member states and chairs of the national roma platforms time to find additional resources to replace this volume that will not be provided at european level 
 the eu can give a powerful contribution to the peace and prosperity of our planet 
 it is clear that we have no time to waste the new results of the ipcc scientific basis of climate change leaving no room for hesitation 
 in the year 2015 one hundred and fifty seven members of this house signed a joint motion for a resolution but after three months this
 this represents a lot less than what we are spending as european institutions on it and digital services 
 we have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text which addresses all our concerns and addresses all our concerns on this matter and calls on international bodies to find a long term legal status for agro reserves 
 let us not be the man of yesterday let us be today s institution 
 we are trying to get this crisis to a point where it becomes visible only when it chokes up the six o clock news so my plea to the commission is that as a result of this crisis let us go out and do our duty as members of the european parliament 
 i thank you especially for that because as you know it was my number one priority this regulation is one of the three measures intended to strengthen the european union and to cut off the sources of financing for criminal and terrorist activities 
 this summer the european union will be able to call their friends from the balkans to heed the warning and check eu membership from leva dijana from leva to brussels from dubrovnik to brussels 
 this will be a key to peace stability and development 
 i think that is becoming a tradition i want to do a yearly debate and i m very happy to participate in this 
 we have to be a people s bank and publicly disclosed and the bonuses of the officers should be linked more to the long term results in order to discourage the company in the long run 
 just as the conflict in the north of ireland has implications in the south of ireland so too does the closure of a clinic in the north of ireland so today the march of disillusioned desperate sick and poor citizens draws much energy from the loss of a clinic and the loss of our response to a crisis of lobbying 
 to conclude footnote is an essential element
 what would be crucial is to add the cost of not acting and not regulating 
 and amplified losses from the collapse of the housing bubble 
 so the same time deeper international engagement remains a
 which is in the heart of his portfolio 
 the deteriorating the dire situation in the gaza strip and the different steps taken by the different actors and the different aspects we had to take into account i am convinced that we have achieved a more than respectable result 
 we have seen the commission and the national competent authorities should focus human and financial resources to get knowledge and skills to implement the competence rules in the digital economy 
 2014 the european council is a key moment in the ongoing process of defining the future of the european union and the role that we can take care of people the only way to do that is by furthering the progress of the european union in supporting healthy and supportive family
 i agree with the intention to ensure that end users will be able to receive the full information of the label even if the product is bought by distance or internet 
 what are the criteria for selecting our strategic partners 
 and as they say in star trek may the force be with you 
 the management arrangement adopted by the statute should be without prejudice to member states law and the regulation should not cover areas other than of the law of the union 
 they do not want an iphone a playstation or chocolate or chips they just want a book and a pen 
 i have met them they are young capable and ambitious they fight for social justice human rights and sustainability 
 with exquisite mechanism only we should all remember the lessons from the history of our continent 
 the report s key elements include the opinion that the eu should deal with plurality clarity platform diversity so no regular platform should be barred because of the digital nature of their activities further of their activities further of their activities further of their activities and of course interoperability rights on line 
 he wants to sit at a negotiating table and discuss a peace treaty 
 it s inseparable and it s been as it s said a sign of general regression for women s rights 
 this is for me the paradox 
 it is worth considering whether this system can deliver the desired results for all stakeholders 
 the decision of the supreme court to go back on its previous ruling leaves a major void 
 we more than doubled funding to fight aids 
 the eu will not be able to finance their green dream if the financial world cannot rely on the bonds 
 as for the non participating states the ftt will be charged not just on transactions that take place within the eleven countries but on any transaction that involves shares or bonds issued by them 
 2011 the possible actions are clear it can reduce prices and increase transparency and increase
 two thousand nine budget is finished 
 so i ask the commission will the social indicators that social indicators are put on an equal footing with economic and financial ones in its policy guidance 
 the mff must play its part in achieving this by standing up against iceland and reaching out to engage young people 
 there is violence but what is hope there is hope 
 president gorbachev was right the eu is the old soviet union dressed in western clothes 
 madam president the link between the economic and the monetary union did not work in the system when we prepared the
 it goes without saying that the union may only adopt legislation where the treaty provides for the power to do so 
 this is of utmost importance and should be the driver of any action taken 
 the amendment for example needs to be very specifically about findings solutions to the unintended consequences and burdens that we have placed upon non financial companies 
 but i find it a bit depressing that in practice the sustainability doesn t seem to be genuinely delivering since it is still inherently flirting 
 we have to find where the problems are 
 the answer has to be holistic and multilateral it has to combine legislative and non legislative measures both of them are important and deserve our attention

 i am asking for no charity i am asking for people back what was taken from them by unjust crises by artificial crises and by bad policies 
 the adoption of the eur 12 billion regulation of the commission the commission s proposal that it intends to propose on equal regulation on the eve of the official product launch before the end of this year to be mainly based on criteria for sustainable fishing 
 the sharing of our fundamental values and the respect for human rights must be an essential condition in our relations with third countries 
 the commission and the presidency are also very clear that this is a very clear very strong independent and fair political decision of the human and financial resources however 
 it is not only the european union which is being called on to negotiate but it is also an obligation for the member states and it is just as an obligation for the commission which is just an agent of the council to also lead and to get an agreement 
 they even plan to shift the election in russia to celebrate occupation of crimea

 all ireland labour market partnership and cross border action are essential to the lives of thousands of eu nationals living in ireland and south as well as to the all island economy 
 we can t do it if we take a new decision 
 the international community has a responsibility to admit officially that mass rape in congo is a war crime against humanity 
 these statements have not received any criticisms either in side line or in mainstream media 
 therefore the classification of the classification of the european personal data protection as financial counterparties for example recently released in a commission draft report seemed to contradict and threaten what we have achieved in the security legislation 
 and
 instead of the eu s own budget the commission is proposing to cut the structural and cohesion funds by eur 1 2 billion and to reallocate these savings to the european agricultural guarantee fund which are sometimes used by member states in the uk and ireland to bail out their failing banks last week the uk government announced that it is seeking an extra gbp 10 billion in the uk s own taxpayers money to bail out the royal bank of scotland

 now is the time for action now is the time for implementation i see a strengthened resolve from all those who care about the future of the planet and to see the opportunities of a modern economy

 if poland is an ingredient in honey then surely it must be added artificially

 the eu should sport the efforts of the un commission of inquiry in investigating outrages carried out in syria 
 behind this invaluable bottle burial there are thousands of stories with names and faces but let me tell you about one today 
 so i think we should stick to the saying if it s not broke don t fix it 
 therefore counsel commissioner i urge you get your act together 
 but i am proud that the high representative is bringing to the table and that her personal success demonstrates how british foreign policy can set comfortably at the heart of today s european union 
 the lebanese people are sick and tired of having to be rescued and i understand them 
 and it is not required to set out reasons for the decision 
 this agency will not be a silver bullet and it will not solve every issue in europe but we must not now and we must not in the future underestimate that this is a highly important fundamental piece in the larger puzzle of our european union policy 
 it is not business europe and the american chamber of commerce whose agenda is the basis for this agreement 
 you know that we work with the electoral action for democracy in nigeria a completely outdated and i hope that you and especially your colleagues can bring that to a positive result 
 the council agrees with the countries of africa the caribbean and the pacific the european union s cooperation with seventy eight countries

 mr president i would like to thank you for your patience and indulgence 
 it s both interesting and depressing to meet the various participants who come to the committee and tell us about their problems 
 so we need more social policies and more policies of education 
 the eu must be properly implemented we need strong improvements on maternity and paternity leave parental leave maternity pay and parental
 and
 what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to enable the eu to enact the istanbul convention 
 the second reason is the interinstitutional equity

 we will come when the people of asia of africa of america and of europe will get together 
 i know you are a reasonable man 
 i call on everyone to conduct the electoral campaign in a decent and tolerant way 
 they cannot be trusted the british legislation is not only a breach of the withdrawal agreement it is a full frontal assault on all aspects of our good friday agreement 
 this is an aspect of an overall package of a more complex picture that includes savings of human rights violations ranging from the well known situation in darfur to international law concerns 
 so i think we should be very cautious in relation to what we do in terms of making any decision to suspend development aid 
 therefore it is high time you come forward with an operational with an operational so to speak the operationalisation of the orban services under a directive 
 at the same time i would like to remind you that the eu is a union of 27 member states and that if you accept that some of them are in a recession you are accepting that there is a recession in the eu if you accept that some of them are in a high unemployment rate you are accepting that there is a high unemployment rate in the eu if you accept that some of them are in a high deficit you are accepting that there is a high deficit in the eu 
 however the focus should be on principles not on specific cases or countries

 again that was not embraced by the council including the uk government 
 even the uk government s own so called balance of competences review shows that foreign policy competence remains squarely with member states and that most of the evidence argues strongly in the uk s interest to work through the eu 
 more than one hundred million of christians suffer from religious persecutions 
 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013

 then we can go further i agree that many things have to be done to improve security and standards of daily life but the idea of creating a new agency of a new entity responsible for raising
 however the topic is only addressed in the context of the overall eu s relations with vietnam as foreseen by article 13 of the eu vietnam free trade agreement this motor vehicle recall capacity and as endorsed by many other eu and asean member states must remain vigilant and active in our
 so it is therefore important for all of us to keep this in mind during future discussions 
 keeping in mind the latest developments in the global trade and investment landscape the commission is revising its overall trade and investment policy including by the adoption of the new trade and investment strategy and by the creation of a new trade and investment policy unit within the commission 
 i would like to thank you mr president for your very engaging contribution and we want to encourage you to continue as you just said so that the section presidency will be successful in its second half as it was in the first half 
 she said a pre existing group is taking control of the election 
 i think that greece will be enslaved by this financial burden for years to come 
 i do not trust the uk government and eu negotiations 
 but both these wars started because governments failed to take steps when they were needed most and in that i see a parallel with the europe our ancestors fought for and the bloc we try not to lose right now 
 in the mediterranean and the equality of races 
 and again it stanks through the great work of investigation journalists that this scandal is revealed 
 we can even use the experience from a different area of policy the visa regime 
 and the romans against rome is two and should not be tolerated and should not be tolerated any longer 
 and my enemy is now within our very ranks and is listening as we speak 
 iranian foreign minister zarif has no agreement no agreement so we do not have any obligation yet iranian leader ayatollah khomeini has nothing nothing 
 each year more than eight million people receive more than four hundred and forty thousand tons of food under this program 
 we also focus on the important medical education and training of health professionals humanitarian care humanitarian goods and will continue to provide an important source of social inclusion 
 2017 was the year when we saw the obstacles to the implementation of the venice commission s banking resolutions and the first resolution under the new framework the popular bank was clearly needed 
 first the consumer will have to pay this bill when the low rates become more expensive the consumer is also the victim of european union harmonisation and the eu s relying mainly on mortgage loans 
 we need to build a legislation on disclosing conditions 
 improving that we don t understand who and with whom arms is killing who is killing even today 
 to reinstate them now would be completely contradictory to the fisheries reform and the cfp will not support that 
 but despite great ambitions we are not yet at that point 
 my view is not expenditure this is not spending this is an investment in the future of this union 
 ladies and gentlemen the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of a very intense and i must say sometimes difficult negotiations between council and parliament 
 but passing laws is not the end of the story for even when child marriage is illegal it is still common 
 so thank you for the commission of taking some firm action on this side 
 the question is are the bonds necessary because the one who selects the offers and furthermore watches over their activity in order to report to the shareholders and supervisors 
 these are values which cannot be left just to free flow 
 there are two tools for enforcing this agreement if russia does not fulfil its commitments therefore this agreement should be seen as a temporary solution until its obligations are fully met and the eu s legal system including the new pnr agreement 
 as those two had i believe in equal treatment and we can deal with an opinion 
 you will not make this into a beauty contest about whose more or less ambitious realistic or less ambitious or more or less cliched we need to pay cliches because too much is at stake we need a clear and ambitious political statement 
 of course if it s not possible for nafta to act for whatever political reason we should be able to act ourselves 
 and we better unite next time and that is one voice 
 but when i read the sargentini report i saw the same old tired narrative of our position of our prejudice and preconceptions which have so far failed to promptly and properly govern any sort of action 
 this debate shows that we are hand in hand in the same direction 
 in this respect i would like to highlight three key issues 
 i love letters everybody speaks a little bit longer if you don t mind i don t open this procedure up because we are running late 
 mr president i was one of the finalists of the presidential elections in
 so again we look to europe to help protect our agreement our peace process and to help us escape from british misrule 
 last but not least how can we win in diversity if a slow is a slow 
 russia has always been a very proud nation with an intense with an intense
 there are areas in which amendments need to be corrected 
 i do not really understand how the british will continue to try to convince trading partners on the sustainability issue because we can only convince our partners if we have the weight of the whole european union with 500 million
 and freedom of speech is entailed 
 and i would like to see an eu china dialogue for our african countries not to mention it not to exploit the resources of this continent but to develop the basic needs of the people in africa 
 so i hope that this will be completed in the future that means that means maybe two or three months 
 one could even execute a transfer just within few hours around the globe for a very fixed and clear price of six price of six 
 so these provisions ensure barriers for everyone and will fundamentally improve the lives of disabled people so please fellow members vote for the green and the red amendments to the treaty 
 how can we ensure that member states deliver on their targets 
 that the commission and the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy and georgia is not lost in this bargaining process if we want to talk in terms of choices there should be no other choice for the east of the region but moving towards the rule of law and democracy 
 we need to take a quick decision if we want to follow the normal procedure i would urge the council to withdraw their legal base accept the commission s legal base 
 they are interested in the democracy but in eea 
 i ve seen myself at madame square with big guns in my hands but but the guns were that big that they were bigger than myself so nobody should say it s no use but people believe it s no use 
 2010 then there are two amendments on existing pilot projects that must be withdrawn and replaced with amendments to create new pilot actions 
 however i believe that in our debate and in our debate with the council we have to be very careful how we approach things because we are a country that is a country that comes through a violent repressive dictatorship 
 openness on the possibilities 
 we are working on their own central bank digital currency and at the end of the day the question is not if the currency is not digital if there will be digital currencies in the future but who will issue and control them 
 mr president i want to focus on two specific areas of this very broad ranging report on organised crime in the eu 
 and
 ah fiesta are out on the fourth amendments so there is no sense there is no filibuster there is no filibustering and political senate is really a very different thing 
 we look into what happened to china after it joined the wto we can see that the growth and the success story of china really began with that date a few years ago 
 his house the parliament no longer has any difficulty in how to interpret the situation 
 in these capacities the commission has been in its competences has regularly responded in the framework of price and services mechanisms in the eu and worked with the eu and the member states 
 it distributes the two mainstream human rights abuse reports by the current government and the iranian nuclear program 
 and so does the rhetoric of world leaders when appropriate and when attending climate change conferences 
 we spoke to his wife this morning 
 we also don t need to leave the back door open to the retreat and to go back to business as usual because we can find such a solution just because we can find some excuses to do this 
 this should be nurtured and supported by all of us 
 we have to ensure access for all to longevity savings micro finance and more that will allow people to improve their lifestyle 
 only an update of the figures for revenue to be paid by the member states but it has an effect on cash flow 
 there is only a slow progress 
 the principle of free movement does not include supporting or rejecting
 the current regional framework and the functioning of the market are not sufficient to provide real solutions to the book mining crisis that visibly impairs still
 there are also a few shortcomings 
 there is no such medical text or treatise which could permit us to cross this international line particularly of non moral humanitarian german jewish line 
 with full respect to our national cultures we can build the pillars of our common future for the years to come 
 if bfv does not do its job germany will lose its reputation in the financial world and investors will lose confidence 
 the iraqi government has been preparing entities of federal resistance parliamentary delegations human rights organisations lawyers human rights lawyers and journalists and even doctors and do not allow many local media to get into iraq 
 i agree with you so i think the urgency that was stretched in many of the contributions is really the agency with which we should look for the result 
 i think we can have another simple yet symbolic gesture which is to introduce more simplified and removing unnecessary requirements 
 in the current phase of the negotiations the responsibility for the entirety of the negotiations rests with the commission and the local authorities whose efforts to meet their obligations unfailingly 
 let us give our citizens the opportunity to choose a transnational list giving people the right to choose their representatives 
 the adoption of the resolution as he said will make his mission close to impossible 
 i am pleased to see that the commission has taken this on board i have often said that the common fisheries policy is a bit like a car with a broken windscreen and the commission is trying to repair it i do not believe that the common fisheries policy will ever be a long term solution to the problems of the fishing industry but i do believe that the common fisheries policy is a bit like a car with a broken windscreen and the commission is trying to repair it 
 thank you for allowing me to put this very simple question 
 this amendment basically has nothing to do with the lack of payment appropriations 
 really hope through your vote tomorrow you will give us your support not to lose any of these achievements 
 more rules and regulation will not improve this situation 
 we here should be a platform for examination debate and most of all for solutions but it is not the european union s function to be both judge and jury in this matter 
 this is a prejudice it is only justified if the coercive coercion is high so is the first factor that i have mentioned satisfied 
 fill that house is better than and doesn t accept 
 in my opinion the proposed limits are acceptable given the risk and the long term effect of radiation has on the health 
 the court will be doing its best to respond to the needs of the european taxpayers on the following themes on the quality of the eu spending finally the court will report to the commission and council on their respective responsibilities for the achievement of the eu s 2020 spending and simplification goals 
 but we should not take away the right of free speech in this issue even if i don t agree with all what he has to say 
 a lot can be done to take this fight to the next level 
 it signals the trust of this overwhelmingly re elected president in a government that repeatedly announced his will to extinguish israel 
 we need to stress that the economic challenges are also a result of the economic policy of a critical mass of people the unemployed the underemployed the inactive the uneducated the unskilled the educated the educated and also the educated in the process of adjustment 
 however there is room for further improvement 
 they are suffering because of the euro their suffering because of an eu project that was not prepared to stand in for greece and to protect the democratic rights of the greek people 
 so it s actually the biggest market on the planet 
 it is external aggression that is the cause of the war and not the war that is the cause of the aggression the war is the result of the aggression
 the legal basis for the commission s proposal to be addressed to the council is the commission s competence so far as concerns the application of any of the commission s existing legislative powers related to the establishment of a voluntary passenger ship insurance scheme 
 how can we plan a common military mission or civil mission if there is no shared assessment of the situation on the ground 
 i would like to draw your attention to the best answer to private individuals such as let us take a look to our global neighbours china japan or switzerland 
 and i know it s very much a challenge but i would like the european parliament to lead on this very topic and not to follow and not to follow that all the developments on the internet are taking a very high and very rapid flight 
 another important consultation for the eu has always been the independent commission impact assessment 
 if we want dignity and stability we need to invest in respect for human rights also by our companies instead of arms and defence we also saw the tragic pictures of the attack on the aquarius 
 i am very pleased to see that this chamber with the support of the european commission that the north koreans are at last willing to discuss denuclearisation starting with a freeze 
 i would add a further question to this as you are a firm believer in the importance of the european neighbourhood policy and the language minorities living in the eu s immediate neighbourhood do you intend to encourage the implementation of the european neighbourhood policy and language minorities living in the eu s immediate neighbourhood 
 the council supports this activity and would welcome other forms of support to member states in their readiness conditions and the capacity of the tissues and cells 
 extreme temperatures floods forest fires earthquakes and even diseases a part of reality and we always need to be able to respond effectively 
 let me also remind you that the list of candidates and neighbouring countries is approved by the parliament in various legal texts 
 it is collecting huge amounts of data on citizens creating detailed profiles and selling them to advertisers and this has side effects 
 we are here to find the best solution and not to find the best compromise with
 president i am very happy that the council also focuses on the council s sectoral working group on the digital single market which is absolutely crucial in freedom and democracy in the future because today this way of living is unavoidable by the business model of a few global technology
 the resolution on the international day of the girl which is in fact modern slavery ensures a fearful and compliant population their intimidation of any opposition including deadly force should be no longer tolerated 
 what this proposal is about is about making very rich companies being socially responsible 
 this is the proof that physical stability leads to growth and employment 
 budgetary appropriations and priorities may turn out to be very different therefore in the coming months and we have to learn to speak to each other one set of numbers especially if we are going to be a common number and by the way what do we mean by a common number in the european parliament because we are the only institution
 like many of my colleagues here this morning i urge commissioner malmström to prioritise an analysis of these disturbing
 i therefore commend the effort shown by this parliament to encourage and build trust in these and confidence in these instruments i am pleased that we have managed to bring this report closer to international standards and ensure that the eu is not placed at a competitive disadvantage globally 
 such decision must be followed by actions with appropriate budget 
 one the words other than the united states should be delisted from the heading and the remarks as decided by the committee on budgetary oversight 
 the reason repeatedly given is that the eu doesn t have the data for individual member states and for that reason the eu will not even attempt to give me an estimate as to the eu has gained from our fishing grounds for the eu is indisputable that the refusal to even give an estimate of that value from our fishing grounds is indisputable 
 we can tackle climate change and halt our emissions and have cleaner air 
 yes now that we are closer than ever to realising this goal the discouraging voices are arising across europe 
 today we call on the republic of philippines to cease immediately all violence and human rights abuses 
 the european union is a global actor but it is also a development actor and the development cooperation which is so important in the delivery of any policy does not contain any explicit reference to the possibility of supporting assistance to countries in cases where a beneficiary country fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe the basic human rights fails to observe
 unfortunately our economy will still suffer for a quite a while not least because of the public budgets and the public infrastructure which are being under sized to take up the huge amount of the human misery 
 some stakeholders have emerged this week of children being possibly trafficked and even abused 
 it is ethically and legally unacceptable to permit cremation of embryos with dna from three parents 
 we also have an internal problem 
 and
 saying this i am not saying that we can shift the focus from prevention to something else but we could have another priority as well for example a full fledged autism
 let me however emphasise that nobody objected to the content of the council s technical update for 2013 which is a mere technical update for 2013 
 let us make europe a better place for ordinary people not for criminals 
 it is however important to note now the time is the time to move on with the implementation of the pillar principles 
 not in the least because migration migration is the very essence of the greek economy it is about saving greece and it is about the greek economy it is about saving greece and it is about the greek national banks 
 it is also driving millions of citizens of citizens and people in the eu into the informal poverty 
 it is encouraging to see the cooperation of the member states at work at key times when as individuals and as a community we face a common threat to our security 
 madam president with the agreement of all political groups i propose that tomorrow s session start at eight 
 about the european funds what are you doing 
 the socialist position is much more complex 
 four years ago i asked for a minute of silence to commemorate them but this house refused 
 i agree with the resolution s conclusion that israel s continued policy of expanding the settlements which are illegal under international law continues to completely undermine the two state solution and will render impossible the creation of a viable palestinian state 
 another measure is our accessibility interference political agenda

 so i think we need far more clarity than you ve given and at this hour it s quite normal that people who are in the group for the first time are not entirely familiar with the entire parliament 
 it s a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outside say that the parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all 
 there is a quotation that is commonly attributed to voltaire i disagree but i say what you say to the death your right to say it

 i remember when i first proposed to have a cash period at the end of the ordinary debate everyone said oh no we can t do that it will mess up the speed of the groupings and so on 
 i mean this is all very contradictory 
 very carefully with such a request to our trade partners as it would also mean that eu producers would have to apply the multitude of rules of origin of the multitude of destinations to which we are exporting

 it is where every country needs to step up and make this a realisation of our time 
 however despite the crisis the eu is facing a two million unemployed
 we have to make sure that next year s budget contains the necessary resources to respond to citizens expectations 
 it does mean however we need a more common political interest all over the european union to be stronger 
 on cites there is a big majority with parliament and also within the commission therefore it would make any sense to challenge this 
 let us have protection against poor pay and have proper social rights regardless of whether people work in industry or in digital platforms

 the discovery of a distressed teenager in dublin this week is a reminder that ireland is affected by human trafficking 
 that was the outcome by the uk government and the european union they were granted two thousand and twelve to operate an obligatory day to day in all parts of the world so in all parts of the world so i think it is for their selfish commitment to their own people and their own nationals 
 commission must ask italy to inform her accordingly 
 and add this vote to the list tomorrow when we have a lot of other things to do 
 we should not let ourselves be distracted by populist speeches which create false links between mobility and supporters on social benefits 
 together we have an enormous potential for economic growth and it has a strategic role as a catalyst for european unity and cohesion and complemented by the value of the euro between the value of the euro and the foreign policy and security policy can do a lot for us both 
 we are not saying we want to do something else

 what i want to do with this copyright reform is to combine responsibility and freedom and that is the balance approach 
 these people were born in the country or have spent most of their lives there and we are talking about more than fifty percent of latvian population or some 1 3 million people 
 in line with the current debate on the way forward i would like to reiterate the commission s commitment to proceed the commission to proceed the commission s approach to a country of origin approach by country of origin the eu already signed a bilateral agreement with mali 
 i call for an independent investigation with international experts to bring light on the circumstances of their death and i expect the european internal action service to keep this issue on the agenda of the high representative 
 i maintain if the eu was the answer it must have been a very silly question 
 when the commission plans to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in europe and in the developing countries 
 but we also need to be helpful to our neighbours who are less fortunate there is a swedish cartoon for children he is called bamse

 we are sending the message that a society can have healthy economic growth only when its members are able to contribute fully to its development 
 the fishing nations of the north sea can decide for themselves whether that is a problem and if so how to deal with it 
 still member states deny us access to some documents that could be accepted 
 this issue is already in the pipeline for a parliamentary follow up with a high representative 
 for example the report talks about the rule of law 
 should be recognised as an integral part of the member states and european institutions 
 because the good friday agreement is based on rights 
 and this has been going on for months 
 what democracy what human rights 
 the evidence is in their flagrant violation of the withdrawal agreement and our good friday agreement 
 it is against the polish constitution and against the treaties and it is against the people of poland who gave the approval in referendum for this
 it was non binding and it was a clear proof of the inappropriate vision of the commission not to say lack of vision that the vast majority of this parliament still forges any intention of implementing this directive 
 and

 um was interviewed outside of raleigh

 we see the enormous progress the country has made since
 we also need a change in our attitude 
 if we are talking about the next financial framework it is very necessary to understand how we will structure the value added because if we will not analyse the budget fully in this financial perspective we will not get the good result in the next one 
 but this multiannual plan will inevitably become less important when the uk leaves the eu and when the majority of north sea stocks will become shared stocks within the terms of international law 
 in june european cans just like their forerunners without paying extra 
 solidarity and voluntary humanitarian and social democracy as a social democracy strongly supporting and strongly thanking my group and everyone who sent me a message to help fellow people and the communities

 um what we can achieve together 
 this is not in place and the commission has done nothing to lead up to the parliament s demands 
 nevertheless they have been using all legal possibilities to prevent the verdict from being enforced 
 i declare a partial interest on this matter 
 i think that together we have managed to produce a report which deserves a plenary vote in favour 
 i think it is important to say that we have been working in a very cooperative way because we understand that either we win together or we will lose separately this is one more example to show that we can deliver and this is one more example to show that we can do the job 
 we need to create a climate that attracts scientists all over the world who want to come here and create breakthrough technologies we need to support the shift from new products and clean technologies 
 on the government s call to do something to come up with positive steps 
 for further information please contact the eu s ambassador in ankara and to overcome the fragility in the country

 gives the first steps with the measure of our rooms and our divans in this union mikhail weiklef we were able to replenish the sovereignty of power by the supporters of men
 the situation in the country is made worse by the absence of parliamentary and judicial oversight and by the fact that their children need protection and education 
 moreover this institution has always been one of the most ambitious when it comes to the budget 
 it was an agreement that so called state and political and political trust of the former united states in the arabian league 
 there is a need for a re enforced role for parliament and the commission civil society and local authorities start from the fact of negotiating the new agreement the new partnership the new agreement and as one going beyond a re enforced and going further than a re enforced
 lies in citizen freedom and legal order 
 the crimes of these reports that will be presented by the socialist members of this parliament and others to make them better and also to make today s debate show very clearly that there is a distinctive policy and a distinctive socialist policy towards the crisis 
 ah dude bankruptcy it would cost
 the eu is a unifying and defensive approach to the crisis and the same applies to the humanitarian treatment as well as in its leading political policy its leading political policy in this area therefore i consider taking this resolution an act of utmost importance 
 investing in broadband but don t tell me that this is okay that this is having any real effect on bringing down the freefall in jobs as we have right now 
 i think we also need to reaffirm our support for the right to freedom of belief 
 have it in the online workbook you want to have it in digital 
 and in the absence of an mep which i firmly believe we shall have to create in the future the better the figures i look at from my own member state of how much international cooperation there is 
 therefore let me stress that it is important that eu strong and focused and that we do not adopt the pace of the slowest rider just for the sake of adopting rules 
 we have to ensure that spending cuts outlined in the results to be achieved
 so let me use my parliamentary speech to tell you what she told me 
 we need to be coherent with our international and transatlantic partners 
 i would also like to particularly thank the rapporteur of this well documented report which allows the european parliament to reflect on the future
 the european commission is actually funding the burials from enterprises two three four five six seven eight nine 
 if we cannot make this cooperation work we will not reap the full benefit of this initiative and our efforts will be in vain 
 if we have this debate tomorrow we will have an opportunity to be at the point of that curve 
 so let us demonstrate today that we mean business and take this vote today 
 to conclude i would like to thank the european parliament for today s debate into the globalisation of the internet which is culturally and socially irreversible it is a cultural and political asset and it is a must for the entire eu 
 it s about time we stopped corporate greed exploiting animals 
 the uninterrupted flow of medical equipment and food has been essential for the functioning of the health system and the continuation of supply chains during the pandemic 
 we are committed to continuing discussions discussing different scenarios and i am the only person in this room who could discuss it in welsh but i am also comfortable in english 
 how will any legal solution affect the development of robotics those who own them and victims of the damage 
 we have to bring member states here and question them why they are not implementing the suggestions that we send to them 
 without truth and remembrance 
 this europe needs to be the most competitive biggest strongest market in the world for most advanced technology but also for most advanced society 
 and valeur is a crucial part of that 
 it signals the trust of this utterly overrated president in a government that repeatedly announces his will to extinguish israel 
 the impact of this will of course be in over the counter sales and here we ve got the small enterprises at risk 
 you have the floor thank you mr president and thank you for giving me the opportunity to make my first speech here in the main plenary 
 if we don t do that we will lose
 mr president this report started life as a perfectly reasonable study into the levels of poverty across the european union and ways in which they may be alleviated 
 the man is seen as a creature that is harmful to the environment without beneficial contribution 
 it is clear that nothing will be solved on nuclear deal until we learn whether washington and in the election is returning to a nuclear deal or continuing with the contingent sanctions mechanism 
 madam president i think that we should discuss whether the eu should do a lot more to make religious freedom a precondition for humanitarian aid and development aid 
 millions of people are being attacked in the world because of their beliefs but there is one minority that is literally hunted with a special cruelty and this is the yazidis 
 it is absolutely shameful that the richest continent of the world does not take proper care of its own children 
 there is nothing wrong with competing on investment climate climate and business climate but there is also a state aid aspect in this area 
 i think the european citizens understand that eu citizenship is not yet for the single action but we have to make sure that we are ready to make a single action for the next
 ah opportunities are unlimited 
 we cannot have this complete imposition of international right of nationalities 
 we must be able to convince others to be as ambitious as we are 
 i am sure more transparency and better information are crucial priorities 
 we are also very specifically identifying and delivering increased levels of debt capacity debt capacity as well as cash flow for the volunteering for the volunteers who would like to go 
 it is all order for one day but do we have an alternative while we are an alternative 
 mr president just to clarify because we are talking about totally different things i was demanding a debate and a vote on a resolution on the azerbaijani constitution 
 on those who most need support for whom the whole project is designed 
 the iraqi government has repeatedly requested different countries including many eu member states to receive them and we have not agreed 
 our resolutions once again call on the israeli government to put an end to its policy of human and democratic rights against the bedouin communities and palestinians living in the west bank 
 this is a further proof that further promotion of common european values by the member states by the commission is needed in the context of growing concerns and examples of restrictions including punitive measures 
 the european parliament the european commission and the council of the european union were all united in their support to be able to
 that heart treatment was needed out by mr puddleduck and mr mole the vicar prescribing him later in the afternoon 
 i fully support this proposal and hope that it will help all european workers 
 what really saddens me is that the commission together with the chosen ones used many misleading facts and misleading facts that would make this report the way they propose they would look good unfortunately only unpaid unpaid 
 this way we can deliver more security for our citizens in the area of prevention i cannot stress enough the importance of preserving trust in the police and need to advance eu and national cooperation as well as
 the eu has 80 million workers in full employment and no adequate labour legislation of settling the vexed question of the minimum of a wage that i and countless friends have visited is about eur 200 
 we deeply regret that the council is proposing budget cuts specifically in those programmes that support education and training policies 
 in the meanwhile the commission recalls that an agreement on the basis of its 2010 proposal is needed with a view to securing a further reduction into
 i am sure that some people think there are important issues of principle here but when principles are tested in this way they start to look ridiculous 
 fish stocks if so many vessels are still operating illegally and with impunity 
 i would like to see the european union as a whole could be able to get a degree in any of the three could be able to get a degree in all of the three this is definitely one of the european labour market s priorities this is definitely one of the european union s priorities 
 i consider that in spite of the opposition to change the legal basis we have to take into consideration the parliament for the parliament to have a say when it comes to the protection of workers and general public from irritating gases and therefore the protection of human health 
 last but not least the eib has decided to widen the negotiating mandate of the nec group of states can the president of the council promise that the council will publish the negotiating directives
 additional sanctions and measures may be imposed by the council with a
 is the commission aware of this new agreement 
 this is and i quote where they underwent their last substantial economic justifying process or working 
 we call on them to immediately cease the murder of freedom of speech and to defend the universal values of freedom of speech 
 one aspect was left aside the situation of european children left behind by the parents who go to work in another european country who go to work in another european country generally called the migrant orphan 
 these things are of course connected 
 good widening on the edges which we believe is very important 
 in the american constitution the famous phrase does a famous phrase in which the president has to take action when he sees a clear and present danger 
 this is your moment to save europe and on this file and that of all european
 riding room on parliament s premises we have proven that this parliament can deal with it in a very responsible way 
 enough pretending that we don t understand what is really happening in ukraine 
 and the second part is there is the rest of the text 
 the european commission is committed to the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and calls for a rapid and effective transition of the european union and its member states including through the full and effective implementation of all the paris agreement 
 it means also using the potential of the european social fund in all member states also using the best practice in national fire safety and also sharing and spreading the best practice to improve the management of fire safety in buildings 
 on the other hand we must address performance gaps and bring the low performing regions back on track if we want to win
 the commission has always appreciated the clear stance of parliament on this matter 
 some would like to try to revive this liberal idea in the developing world although it found its waterloo in the financial crisis here 
 the interconnectors with third countries should be shared the universities the energy sources and the energy sources of the union security of supply not just for those who meet the criteria 
 um vulnerability has to have a real observable new memory states also have to have a key role in the discussions in bringing forward this initiative 
 in relation to the statement made by the star of the show who worked for the parliamentary parties excluding responsible citizens for this house and we should never shift it to members of staff who cannot defend themselves 
 they have continually reinterpreted modified and ignored the good friday agreement to suit their domestic political agenda 
 and my second point i welcome president tusk s commitment to the democratic republic of sri lanka 
 you have left over one hundred million people after the last crisis in eighty eight and eighty nine 
 for this the focus agency must disclose certain information regarding the vetted instrument 
 we can look to some non eu members for good examples as regards the knowledge economy 
 the ukraine has shown its willingness to meet our concerns through the mediation of pace and the azerbaijani council of europe 
 copenhagen we look back and we stood alone in our ambitions 
 the green paper addresses the challenges of policy in the field of education with binding measures implementing article eight of the lisbon treaty by matching policy on the level of the eu with actions by matching words and deeds with transparency by matching
 in the case of amendments covering several budget lines the vote refers to all the lines covered by them 
 and then you have to think of buying the use of alternative fuels including hydrogen and the deployment of the associated infrastructure 
 did she oppose his demand 
 i would like to see our vetting process reviewed our economic models and reviewed the eu israel association agreement because it is not unreasonable for us to expect the people that we trade with particularly 
 we we had time slots distributed 
 on a much wider note i think the member states need to review policy regarding every eu trade and in particular our financial support that keeps this disastrous regime in power 
 i am convinced that we will not have the chance to reform the european elections 
 the conclusion of the framework agreement provides a legally binding instrument to uphold eu and stakeholder obligations and to increase cooperation 
 expanding the institutional environment to these marriages or less of a list of exempted classes would be growing enmity and we believe the objectives of the capital market union 
 i saw this situation when i was in this region just two months ago these negotiations show the potential of like mindedness between like minded partners 
 and
 simplifying and enhancing the process of accession and preparation of civilian and military potentials is an important step towards this goal 
 i watched in horror an already overcrowded uk devoid by hundreds and thousands of uninvited foreign workers who arrived for their benefit and claimed our welfare 
 the caliph over there is talking about a trade agreement with japan 
 how can we protect europeans and value from russia s hateful and divisive warfare if each member state works on its own intelligence of its own intelligence 
 last but not least we have significantly increased our delivery of in kind assistance to the syrian people 
 i would like to underline the excellent election observation by parliament and the forming of a national coalition government and a commitment to a democratic 
 i am very proud of the efforts of the ecr group and the epp in getting as well as germany and others that are stepping up not just funding but bringing teams and beds so we can fight and beat ebola together 
 so we must send a united message without amendments which will undermine and weaken this resolution which only covers the eib the european investment bank 
 personally i believe that today we need more awareness from the member states that we need a true european policy 
 if we do not act now we will not only fail in meeting our climate obligations we will also miss out on reaping the rewards of green innovation in the years to come 
 2014 the importance of the european investment plan for jobs growth investment and stability in lithuania and also in the neighbouring countries i would like to highlight the need to set up the necessary funds to establish a european union observer mission on the ground building on existing institutions 
 we acknowledge that this action plan brought the polish government in an obligation 
 ukraine law imposes a maximum sentence of seven years on the perpetrators of this crime and it simply not as strong enough 
 let me mention a few issues of great importance for us 
 we will support you in your initiatives in all the priorities that we all share here 
 the future of education depends on us making sure that all individuals without discrimination have access to education 
 you also don t want to be criticised by others when we put conditions on the aid we give 
 for instance the remedies provisions prove to be a tool that develops up to three times the total of the official development aid by contributing to the economy of the country of origin 
 and mobilise them to vote in these elections 
 and in the time of migration we are facing not only challenges of migration but also challenges of cross border crime terrorism and perhaps even hybridisation which can be something which is also for our citizens a challenge and people to trust 
 she was a prime minister and she was a leader agreeing that the legislation concerning the single market could be done by majority voting 
 this definition is very clear and has served as a solid basis in international trade for decades so why change it 
 i observe the living conditions of gays lesbians bisexuals transgendered and intersexed with their far reaching effects on employment on infrastructure and any semblance of normal life 
 the commission is also willing to consider the possibility of providing humanitarian assistance to the people of venezuela and the commission is also willing to consider the possibility of providing humanitarian assistance to the people of venezuela and the commission is also willing to consider the possibility of providing humanitarian assistance to the people of venezuela and not by what we know but by what we do not know 
 the second source is a lot of smaller changes that in many ways have been in the pipeline for a long time but rather than have a string of reports changing the rules on mining points we have grouped them together 
 we have to find where the problem is 
 eu citizens have a right to be able to shop online in other eu countries just like the local ones do that is the core idea behind the digital single market that is the core idea behind the digital single market that we have been working on in the european parliament i would like to thank the ecr group
 mr president i would like to use the opportunity to use the opportunity to say that i withdraw my name from this report 
 what we have done in this year is to try and put in place a new european commission a new presidency of the european council and a new foreign affairs council with the high representative and vice president of the european commission as well as the secretary general of the council and the president of the european parliament 
 we must have courage to defend modern invention 
 this is not only about trade it s about human rights 
 these statements have not received any critical reviews either inside or in mainstream media 
 the commission will study the most appropriate means to achieve this objective in the union taking into account the international conventions on the matter 
 finally it is fundamental to promote the acceptance of an international role in ending the conflict in syria 
 
 has a great pulling effect on each single government to change for the eea and use the new eea technologies 
 it s symbolic who takes the floor on the floor and that s not the kind of signal we want to send to the person whom we are defending today 
 the european union is based on common values common goals a respect for human rights and minority traditions and equal treatment for all eu residents regardless of their origin language or religion 
 i and many of my colleagues have a concept of the phasing in development of digital currency and the dominoes of the global technological companies 
 it is essential that we cooperate effectively and in particular with all our partners sharing information about firearms trafficking and terrorist financing and learning from our previous mistakes 
 and i will also stress very much what has already been said here 
 and without any doubt the position of my republican friends is consistently against brexit 
 i welcome that the report also highlights the rights of minorities within our own eu especially our bilingual and bicultural communities and i hope that the irish authorities take note of the contents of this report and work towards addressing these concerns 
 so much for your so
 and finally i very much support everybody who spoke about root causes of this problem 
 we understand that some people are angry 
 the major shortcomings have been corrected and the result is now technically sound and logical for which i thank mrs schaldemose and her team and also the other shadow rapporteurs who have been working with this 
 we have to accept that the commission is responsible for the implementation of the treaty and as a more simplistic and unified legal structure we should be seeing greater effectiveness in the european union 
 if this house does not want to walk on the leash of one member state i suggest to vote against the amendments in support of the original text 
 the european union and its member states have contributed enormously to the effort and are of course under obligation to be ever under education but there is much to be done to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the institution as well as of the legislature 
 and
 membership has said that marriage is often the end for girls but if our leaders will invest in us and give us the chance to be educated we will become women who create a better society for everyone
