 these negotiations show the potential of cooperation between like minded partners like us 
 and
 the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis vis the citizens our role as a parliament is a parliamentary one and we are the voice of the citizens we cannot and we must not say to the citizens that a big common policy like the external action service will lie outside the democratic control of our parliament 
 the same holds true for the intention to reinforce the provisions on market surveillance in order to ensure proper and widespread enforcement of the injunctions directive and its implementing measures

 the copernicus summit was a disappointment in many respects 
 this document should be considered therefore as a staple in the road for the total ban of atomic weapons

 for more than four months elected politicians and civil society leaders have been in prison in pre trial detention for their political activities 
 an agreement will be possible only if we see concrete action and real change in the government legislation 
 we are seeing that the environmental effect of products must be a very important issue in the eu and the whole idea of the ecolabel gives a very useful orientation for the consumers of course the eco label should be given to the most environmentally friendly products the information should be clear and correct

 it calls upon the commission and member states to enhance their support to reconciliation to secure peace and stability and to secure peace and stability in ireland i would therefore urge colleagues to support this amendment 
 nevertheless they have been using all legal possibilities to prevent the verwer scenario from happening 
 no that is not true because we have bigger challenges 
 but military interregencies are no excuse for human rights violations reprisals and the government of mozambique has the responsibility to protect its citizens not make them fear for their lives

 this sentiment has been strengthened by widespread corruption and lack of implementation of much needed reforms 
 efficiency is important but we also must spend
 and a cultural shift here in europe from savings to investment is critical 
 we want to use countries to choose europe but we also have to bear in mind that europe we want them to choose europe but we also have to bear in mind that europe we want them to choose is not based on dividing lines we are not building an exclusive club here and by bringing ukraine and the others closer to the eu we should also see them as bridge builders it is key that there is a bargaining game going on between brussels 
 certain states like myanmar and hungary implement direct aid on the ground for this persecuted community 
 the great innovation union the digital agenda access to all the next generation network and so on

 the sharing of our fundamental values and the respect for human rights must be an essential condition in our relations with third countries 
 and national competition authorities but also the report says very clearly that this independence is strongly linked to the availability of the human and financial resources however 
 the country in a hybrid situation when it is not capable to control its borders and when it is not willing to control its borders and when it is not willing to get an assistance from the agency which is just an assistance and not a replacement for the work of sovereign nations can also lead to the situation where member countries decide for temporary reasons and for security reasons to introduce also borders control with this country because
 they even planned to shift the election in russia to celebrate occupation of crimea 
 we worked hardest in terms of definition of energy poverty 
 parliament also appeals to national lawmakers to clearly distinguish high risk or low risk assets from those assets which are eligible for usage type covered bonds leaving as a me too credits infrastructure investment in the new instrument which as i have said would be called european secured notes

 she accepted the fact that citizenship is a national part of the national jurisdiction but she also said that according to the macrist treaty and she is right there has to be a direct link
 indeed debating ideas in a public forum makes it harder for those ideas to be formed as an individual insult and a public debate provides the target of offence with a rebuttal

 we cannot do it if we take a new decision 
 the international community has to admit officially that mass rape in congo is a war crime against humanity 
 these statements have not received any criticisms either inside latvian rule of law or in mainstream media 
 therefore the classification of securitisation special purpose entities as financial counterparties for example recently released in a commission draft report seem to contradict and threaten what we have achieved in the securitisation legislation 
 and
 it is time for us to bring some evidence based clarity into this discussion on eu citizens mobility and member states well being and member states welfare systems instead of allowing the euro scapegoats to band around misleading statistics and inflammatory arguments which are sometimes used by ukip and other xenophobic extremists in the uk last week in the uk and newspapers article entitled the eu last week in the uk and newspapers article entitled the eu last week in the uk and newspapers article entitled the eu last week in the uk and newspapers article entitled the eu last

 the lebanese people are sick and tired of having to be resilient and i understand them 
 it is not required to set out reasons for the decision

 you know that we work with the electoral action from 1976 completely outdated and i hope that your team and especially you and your colleagues can bring that to a positive result 
 the council agreement with the countries of africa the caribbean and the pacific concerns the union s cooperation with 78 countries

 mr president thank you for your patience and indulgence 
 it is both interesting and demanding to meet the various petitioners who come to the committee on petitions and talk about their problems

 unfortunately this is just an aspect of a more complex picture that includes several violations of human rights ranging from the well known situation in darfur to international criminal law concerns 
 so i think we should be very cautious in relation to what we do in terms of making any decision to suspend development aid 
 therefore it is high time you come forward with a proposal for a review with an operational separation of the audit and non audit services under a direct eu supervisory
 but can i remind you that an unemployment of 11 1 is 20 million unemployed people and can i remind you that at the d20 summit at the g20 summit with some resistance from some european leaders you accepted that if there is a reason we are willing to do more to engage in having a high economic growth the president of the commission i have twenty seven million good reasons to do more that is why i have an appeal to you today 
 however the focus should be on principles not on specific cases or countries

 again that was not embraced by the council including the uk government 
 even the uk government s own so called balance of competences review shows that foreign policy competences remain squarely with member states and that most of the evidence argues strongly in the uk s interest to work through the eu

 i think that greece will be enslaved by this financial burden for years to come

 i am both these wars started because governments failed to take steps when they were needed most and in that i see a parallel with the europe our ancestors fought for and the belarus we try not to lose right now 
 i believe in democracy and equality of races 
 and again it stinks through the great work of investigation journalists that this scandal is revealed 
 we can even use the experience from a different area of policy the visa regime

 firstly the consumers will have to pay this bill when the low risk loans become more expensive the consumers ordinary european homeowners and the smes relying mainly on mortgage loans 
 we need to build a legislation on data sharing conditions 
 enough pretending that we do not understand who and with whom arms is killing 10 ukrainians every day 
 to reintroduce them now would be completely contradictory to the fisheries reform and the sgp will not support that 
 but despite great ambitions we are not yet at that point 
 my view this is not expenditure this is not spending this is an investment in the future of this union 
 ladies and gentlemen the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of very intensive and i might say sometimes difficult negotiations between council and parliament 
 but passing laws is not the end of the story for even when child marriage is illegal it is still common 
 mr president thank you for the commission taking some firmative action on this side 
 qualifications are necessary because the board is the one who selects the officers and furthermore watch over their activity in order to report to the shareholders and supervisors 
 these are values which cannot be left just to free flow 
 there are not too many tools for eu to enforce this agreement if russia does not fulfil its commitments therefore this agreement should be seen as a temporary solution until its replacement by a legally binding agreement included in the new partnership and cooperation agreement 
 as those two had i believe in equal treatment and we can deal with an opinion 
 if you do not make this into a beauty contest about whose more or less ambitious realistic or less realistic or more or less willing to pay we need four clarities because too much is at stake we need a clear and ambitious political stance 
 of course if it is not possible for nato to act for whatever political reason we should be able to act ourselves 
 and we better unite next time and that is one voice 
 but when i read a franco scottish mogherini s letter i saw the same old tired repetition of our positions and preferences which have so far singly failed to prompt israel to govern itself

 russia has always been a very proud nation with rich culture with inventions with an expertise

 one could even execute a transfer just within a few hours around the globe for a very fixed and clear price of six 
 these provisions ensure barriers for everyone and will fundamentally improve the lives of disabled people so please fellow members vote for the trant and the green amendments tomorrow 
 how can we ensure that member states deliver on their targets

 we need to take a quick decision if we want to follow the normal procedure i would urge the council to withdraw their legal base accept the commission s legal base
 they are all important in the democracy but in the environment

 opinion on the possible changes
 are working on their own central bank digital currency and at the end of the day the conclusion is not if there will be digital currencies in the future but who will issue and control them 
 mr president i want to focus on two specific areas of this very broad ranging report on organised crime in the eu 
 i m a little bit nervous 
 fitters are out on the field amendments so there is no censorship there is no filtering and political censorship is really a very different thing 
 if we look into what happened to china after it joined the wto we can see that the growth and the success story of china really began with that date a few years ago 
 his house parliament knows how difficult and how intractable the situation
 in these chaos the european commission within its competences has quickly responded in the framework of crisis and civil protection mechanisms in the eu and worldwide 
 it distinguishes the two main dossiers human rights abused by the current government and the iranian nuclear program 
 and so does the rhetoric of world leaders when appropriate and when attending climate change conferences 
 ah we spoke to his wife this morning 
 we also do not need to leave the back doors open to for the retreat and to go back to the business as usual with russia just because we can find some excuses to do this

 there are also a few shortcomings 
 there is no such medical technique or treatment which could permit us to cross this internationally agreed principle of non modification of human germ line

 if bafin does not do its job germany will lose its reputation in the financial world and investors will lose confidence 
 iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of ashraf residents parliamentary delegations human rights organisations lawyers and journalists and even doctors to the camp and do not allow many local materials to get into ashraf 
 i agree with you so i think the urgency that was stressed in many of the contributions is really the urgency with which we should look for the result 
 another thing we can have simplified audit swaps well introducing more simplified approach and removing unnecessary requirements 
 the european union s own experience in fulfilling its responsibilities is entitled to receive the necessary support from the community and the local authorities whose efforts to meet their obligations unfortunately are often fortunately of limited
 let us give our citizens the opportunity to choose a transnationalist giving people their right to choose this is democracy 
 the adoption of the resolution as he has said will make his mission closer to impossible 
 of course there is a long way to go emanating from the commission s own communication of 2007 i mentioned this in my opening remarks i have often said that the commission s policy is a bit like an oil tanker it takes a considerable time to turn round but at least in its original version it takes a considerable time to turn round i have often said that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker it takes a considerable time to turn round but at least in its original version it takes a considerable time to turn round i have often said that the common
 mr president thank you for allowing me to put this very simple question 
 this amendment by the socialists has nothing to do with the lack of payment appropriations 
 i really hope through your vote tomorrow you will give us your support not to lose any of these achievements 
 more rules and regulation will not improve this situation 
 we should not be afraid of examining the past and we should not be afraid of solutions but it is not the european union s function to be both judge and jury in this matter 
 this prejudicial treatment is only justified if the collateral quality is high so as the first factor that i have mentioned is indeed satisfied 
 fill that this house is better than and doesn t accept 
 in my opinion the proposed limits are acceptable given the risk and the long term effect cyanide radiation has on the health 
 the court will remain doing its best when responding to the needs of the european taxpayers owing them on the quality of the eu spending finally respect for the commission and the council for their acceptance of our expertise and their enthusiasm today about streamlining and simplifying the future spending schemes 
 but we should not take away the right of free speech and this issue even if i don t agree at all what he has to say 
 a lot can be done to take this fight to the next level 
 it is a signal that trust in this utterly over rated president in a government that repeatedly announces his will to extinguish israel

 how can we plan a common military or civilian mission if there is no shared assessment of the situation on the ground 
 and the digital single market is the best answer to private initiatives such as levi s let s take a look at our global neighbours china japan or switzerland

 another important consultation for the epp group has always been the independence of the commission s impact assessment
 if we want dignity and stability we need to invest in respect for human rights also by our companies instead of in arms and defence we also saw the tragic pictures of the attack in lahore 
 having returned from azerbaijan i come to this chamber with the perception that the north koreans are at last willing to discuss denuclearisation starting with a freeze

 we are here to find the best solution to save the planet and not to find the best compromise with our companies

 such decisions must be followed by actions with appropriate budget 
 one the words others than the united states should be deleted from the heading and the remarks as decided by the committee on budgets 
 the reason repeatedly given is that the eu does not have the data for individual member states and for that reason will not even attempt to give me an estimate as i said the eu has gained from our fishing grounds an indisputable right to even give an estimate of that value from all data that they do have is not acceptable 
 we can tackle climate change and half our emissions and have cleaner air 
 yet now that we are closer than ever to realising this goal disparaging voices arise across europe 
 today we call on the republic of the philippines to cease immediately all violence and human rights abuses 
 it is the way you look at it but the regulation establishing the financial instrument for the development cooperation which is so important and which we take a lot of pride in does not contain any explicit reference to the possibility of suspending assistance to third countries in cases where a beneficiary country fails to observe the basic human rights principles 
 unfortunately our economies will still suffer for quite a while not least because of the public budgets and probably future inflationary effects of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess 
 some stroke examples have emerged this week of children being possibly traded and even abused

 in 2015 there were almost 30 000 newly diagnosed hiv infections reported within the eu ee region 
 in all of this we have to understand how robotisation of industry and professions will affect our workers and our professionals and find ways to provide the right skills and support 
 i am hopeful that the european parliament will look beyond europe to the suffering countries where people are still deprived of their basic rights where freedom of thought is suppressed
 the results have been very very dangerous for the whole financial market but also personally for those people because there were huge numbers of personal tragedies of people who were evicted from their houses just for the incapability to pay their mortgages

 we know the mechanism that can help amendatory due diligence for all enterprises in our common market people in europe know that forests are the lungs of our planet

 will you take action at last if not then when 
 i am afraid that it has more to do with upcoming october elections than with any substantial changes in the government s approach to human rights and political freedom 
 this success relies on basically two factors 
 but the good news is that we know how to change the chance to change this with the new competition framework with a digital services act 
 2014 for every 100 tanker trucks 3 million tonnes of co2 can be revented and 7 million tonnes of nox can be avoided

 we europeans are all stronger together and i hope we will steer no efforts in securing our collective interests and values in the world 
 but one thing is important 
 the finance production is destined to become more european and arms export control mechanisms will need to reflect this new reality 
 through our vote we will surely support this resolution 
 since two thousand and five the council has carried out an annual statistical survey among member states on quantitative data relating to the functioning of the european arrest warrant 
 therefore i share the concern of my colleagues regarding the expected recommendation of the bailiwick committee on capital flight as set out from mr ferber this evening good for the us bad for europe i sincerely hope that the commission will not take into account that one size fits all 
 it would bankrupt small businesses up and down uk high streets and deprive consumers of such vehicles that do not have the resources to accommodate such regulation 
 and
 to conclude what remains to be done and where this report is silent on is to remove the market distortions which set cbs at a competitive disadvantage vis vis the eib government bonds 
 that needs to be fixed otherwise we will not have the alliance with developing countries that we need to make the future meetings a success 
 our resolution is the european answer to president obama s proposal of a new coalition of the willing 
 with this debate we would like to receive more information on the future interinstitutional design and the future interinstitutional design between the joint council and the joint parliamentary assembly let me

 the use of data is growing rapidly 
 the world will not stand idly by while people work and even die as slaves to build the venue of one of our greatest sporting competitions 
 and i understand also from his words here that he has been forced by the troika to bend to their financial demands and now he is speaking their language 
 and
 around four hundred people die each day in the european region from causes related to viral hepatitis despite the availability of prevention and treatment 
 this is what they should have done yes and this is what they should do not that the regulation should have been adopted 
 however the commission has shelved on corruption in the european union while the cooperative monitoring mechanism for both romania and bulgaria has been maintained 
 mr president commissioner i wish to focus my remarks on the european neighbourhood policy and the relationship with the middle east peace process 
 we must all operate under an umbrella of respect for democracy and the rule of law 
 i think that the past two weeks have confirmed our concerns i hope that recent events as devastating as they are might prove to be a turning point for turkey 
 as such all three infections require long term and sustained programmes often targeting overlapping population groups 
 it has the potential to become a milestone in our relations with the eastern partnership countries 
 the dictatorship not only enforces the inhabitants to live in conformity with its religious standards but it also tries to kill everyone who does not behave conformed to its system the consequence is that many iranians have to live in exile not only in europe but also in the neighbouring countries 
 otherwise we won t make it again 
 but i think that all european union as said in my speech must have the same quality of security founding members on non founding members

 seventeen member states are less than
 the european union has a strong interest in the success of the peace process in the region and what is more there is a new momentum in eu china relations to create new interregional architecture but it could speed it over the security affairs in east asia two trends beg merit attention in the diplomatic track on north korea and thus this creates a vacuum
 europe s competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation 
 we must find an alternative ways of to use public money leveraging more private investments in this kind of transformation that we need 
 we need to invest in the infrastructure in digital skills and life long learning in improving the connectivity of remote areas in the new initiatives like the european online university in the new tools creative tools and devices that have been developed across europe 
 and let us end the rhetoric of free trade that tries to convince people that trade only needs to be free to work for the people because this neglects the hardship of those without jobs in de prived regions 
 the umbrella is not just a symbol of the protests 
 the wording needs a minor adjustment which i will introduce as an oral amendment at the vote 
 we also need to increase security measures to prevent europeans travelling to join isis 
 we should specifically focus our efforts on those young people who are not in employment education or training 
 by doing this you are not contributing to a constructive eu role in the current situation 
 and in unjustified geo blocking practices is one concrete step in the right direction but i believe it should be done in a way that does not hamper smes and start ups as well as does not raise prices for consumers especially in newer member states 
 we desperately need more coordination if we are to emerge from the crisis if we are to combat unemployment and poverty 
 we support this new law as a compromise normal and serious compromise 
 i must say that i am appalled by the homophobia that i have heard 
 i am however worried that the winter package proposed by the commission is a missed opportunity if we want to unleash the full potential of the green transition 
 we are insisting on the community method we say very clearly that we are not ready to agree on the expenditures without a proper agreement on future own resources 
 in its green paper to which i have already referred the commission sets out some of the activities related to the issue of detention conditions and for which it provides support through various financial programmes the commission also has a regular dialogue with the council of europe on these issues 
 thank you we now move to the catch the eye part of the debate 
 the reality is that hard working migrants and immigrants have been coming to the birmingham and west midlands in my constituency for centuries just as hard working people from the west midlands have travelled in search of work and new opportunities for centuries 
 conversion and degradation of this ecosystem has been happening at a higher pace than for amazon rainforest region and it is clear that these ecosystems will be exposed to increased pressure to be turned into agricultural land 
 it is important to have the debate and the vote this week as the commission is expected to adopt the edis decision with japan at the end of this year latest early 2019 therefore in order to feed into the process parliament needs to adopt its resolution beforehand 
 the commission will be based on more than just the commission s treaty a week and that is what we would be delivering for the safety of health workers 
 we do not even know yet how many waves of low skilled workers will hit europe we do not know how long and often restraints and hotels remain closed in major cities with substantial reductions in mobility of members staff and visitors and business opportunities for our fishermen the amounts proposed by the commission are well below what is needed 
 i would urge the commission to become ambassadors of the year make its ideas and activities widely known amongst european citizens and participating in events be it at european national or local level 
 1 9 9 point nine is not coming on time to call for money this year 
 they attack all of us 
 is it not clear to you that until proper free movement between spain and gibraltar is reinstated by your government any concept of the eu having as a weight on the international stage to use your own phrase is a complete impossibility 
 the european council would do well to face up to the reality that britain is not interested in being a friendly neighbour 
 the regulation lays down the rules for our banks and other payment service providers regarding information on the payer and the payee they need to collect and transfer though the whole payment chain 
 that is the reminder that in many areas of international relations it is not the european union that calls the shots but other international organisations and that britain is already a member of many of those organisations 
 so thank you very much commissioner for your efforts for the work you have done 
 i think we can declare it adopted or not adopted 
 this way the european union will be more effective in providing security will increase its autonomy and will most notably make wise use of the relevant budget which regrettably continues to be underfunded 
 the eu should recognise that in this it is really palestinian conflict there are competing claims over the west bank and it makes no sense to stand on the palestinian side of the conflict the eu should recognise that both palestinians and jews
 in reality the upsurge of sectarian violence including against christians are all spillover effects of various crisis situations that have destabilised the region and have deepened divisions among various ethnic and religious lines 
 for example would it be like to see more concrete information on how the eib financial instruments make the access to smes for funding especially when it comes to higher risk projects 
 my point is the following now in a few weeks you will meet mr obama the new president of the united states 
 in our groups we always have discussion in the evening before a vote how the groups are both
 why georgia must continue the reforms of its judicial system and its work on minority rights 
 the article limits existing rights and eliminates well functioning minority language schools which work very well so far 
 the passenger as well as the bed got on board without any problems and landed in ireland 
 as far as the integration of the amending letter i for 2011 in parliament s reading is concerned some technical adjustments need to be made in both the new european union european external action service and the commission following the proposed transfers of appropriations between sections 
 especially when we are talking about our neighbourhood in africa this is really also about our security without development in this region we will be also in trouble 
 it s been fair and let s create the jobs 
 you enter into the register rightfully so that you meet a lobbyist 
 at least we would like to know the source of the money and the possible motives 
 i was here just less than five weeks ago on 7 september and in this short period of time the numbers of cases has almost doubled 
 i m sure mr president you you would already let him do so now if he wanted but fortunately he doesn t want to 
 fundamental rights are the basis on which the eu is founded and lie at the heart of everything it does 
 the next report on eu s accountability should include the above mentioned policy changes as well as its financial commitments 
 that s the devastating reality of iraq today a country of escalating violence where according to the un eight hundred people were killed in august alone 
 do you believe it s a state 
 in these hard times of the economic crisis we should respect the interests of the producers as well and i am sure that this report balances the interests of the consumers and the industry it is very important to involve the small and medium sized enterprises the smes in the process 
 we can find different ways of doing this and where member states have got effective systems in place and there are many member states who do and we need to take into account that those systems work effectively 
 is there to ask a question of the speaker 
 let us prove together not competing with each other but together that that is not the case 
 i also believe that in order to fully guarantee competition the principle of net neutrality should be strictly followed 
 the eu will continue to support the peace process including through the quartet and will continue to work for a two state solution rather than on any specific israeli land for peace initiative on the other hand the eu and the eu member states are often on the same side in the un and other international forums such as the middle east quartet the council of europe the osce the oecd the international monetary fund the world bank and the world trade organisation on the other hand the eu is taking a leading role in the fight against climate change such as the
 the eu as an important rule taker plays an important role in addressing this issue as europe is currently a destination market for trafficking in transit to other regions as well as for some species the source region for illegal trade the eu is a part of the problem but also a big part of the solution 
 it is not only market it is not only technology it is new relationships in the whole society new type of services new type of well being new type of engagement and development of people for that i suppose it is very important also to build trust
 mr president for her commitment and a great job during the negotiation process with a commission and a council during the estonian presidency 
 they need association agreement as soon as possible in the beginning of next year 
 this means that in practice also international ngos are asked to be more ambitious in our climate policy 
 post financial crisis the use of securitisation has severely diminished across europe however 
 older people people with disabilities we also insist on including built environment related to the provision of goods and services 
 mr president last week s elections in israel show that the majority of citizens supported the parties that see the reinforcement of the military and the best way to protect the country 
 while countries are told to cut on social expenses europe is at the same time still massively subsidising environmentally harmful industries 
 mr president this is a mere matter of major significance for ireland even more so now that the eu has lost the uk 
 the agreement between the council and parliament will remove barriers to e commerce by avoiding discrimination based on consumers nationality place of residence or place of establishment 
 it must refer to the case of justice 
 one of the principles of our future economic models is resource efficient europe 
 the south koreans have sent out a whole delegation of people to fan out around the world to seek support for the peace process 
 when you talk about automatic stabilisers it is already in the programmes and the prognoses 
 however the area of the uk that i elected myself and my colleague jim carver from west midlands as well we have some of the poorest people all across europe in our area these people cannot afford the things that other people can afford the things that other people take for granted they cannot get work and when you take the money that could be spent on their schools
 we know very well that there is an important link between education and employment 
 we must boost digital economy innovations well being and jobs in europe 
 number one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven 
 so i hope that this will happen for russia as well and that russia can also visit an extreme success story after this significant data in august this year 
 and other cultures have different opinions on that 
 very complicated because it was great political support for the idea 
 it was too difficult for this parliament to commemorate this event 
 so i would like to finish on a personal note by expressing my appreciation of the valuable work done by members of the pnr committee throughout and by thanking commissioner borg and his team for all that they have achieved in their five years at the helm 
 the amendment is following the importance of secure diversified and affordable energy supply a pillar of economic social and political transition and of securing a competitive and prosperous economy for all ukrainian
 so there s a lot of interesting things in here there s
 and europe here could show the way by having with us pledges that will make others believe in our climate policies that will make others find solutions to their own climate policies and our policies and that will show the way forward 
 we are interested in cooperation with our partners in the eu to fight against fraud but such cooperation should be based on the honest and not discriminatory rules 
 it allows the mutual recognition of protection measures which are based on civil law rather than criminal law i would like to ask my colleagues to support this proposal 
 after the anglo american military invasion in iraq the iranians who live there in exile got the guarantee to be protected against iran 
 that means that individual vulnerable member states would again be liable to falling prey to isolation and costly bailouts at their taxpayers expense the link between banking and sovereign bonds would not be severed and at the same time people would end up paying for systemic failures of the eurozone something that all responsible member states have always said they would not accept 
 and of course we are asking for a sufficient overall flexibility 
 lastly the most important thing i think is that this report tries to establish a complete system of transparency not transparency for every institution separately but transparency on an institutional basis where all the institutions are taken into account where the principles of good administration are
 and
 we are dealing with a fundamental right not with charity 
 we see what is happening in turkey 
 we will ask the commission to come up with a legal framework to prevent this and make supply chains bringing products to market sustainable 
 that s a huge work and i am very glad that we in our committee and between committees we all agree that it is a crucial and in all opinions of committees i found that commission is really expected to put
 you are attacking the principle of proportionality and the principle of representation by depriving a lot of polish citizens of their voices 
 firstly increasing energy efficiency is the quickest and the most cost effective manner to reduce greenhouse gas emissions secondly the energy efficiency can be part of the solution of the current economic recession raising energy demand and in energy use can contribute to create long lasting growth and solid jobs opportunities 
 yes mr president i refer to article 182 to a and to b education of speaking time yesterday when we were discussing the guantánamo prison here in the chamber i and several other speakers were interrupted without mercy when we had exceeded our speaking time by a few seconds 
 5 5 and lastly the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery 
 we also ask the commission to determine the key priority actions to strengthen the industrial competitiveness to increase the innovation capacity to enable companies to compete in domestic and global markets and reinforcing the capacity of the union and its member states to support the development of businesses especially small and medium
 regulatory clarity and certainty is needed for the public sector and for the industry 
 so with today s resolution we aim to fulfil our moral and political duty as european democracies by trying to save mr sensi s life and help to regain his freedom as well as those of all other names in the resolution held in russian captivity deprived of freedom and human dignity even of legal and medical assistance 
 as has been said it is to revise the ebt transposition policy in order to open financial opportunities for sustainable and digital innovations 
 the development policy is about development 
 the arctic council is a contact point with the syrian national council and if so could you elaborate on this 
 i think that the european parliament should be able to open its doors to this framework 
 in the us it was a decision taken only by one person the former president of the united states against the articulated democratic majority of the us congress by all of its republican and some of its democratic democrat members it was an agreement without any binding obligations as the leaders of iran very openly and precisely on the very day this so called deal was published
 mr president i would like to use the opportunity to say that i withdraw my name from this report 
 eu and bilateral diplomacy of our countries must achieve the violence of human rights and autocratic attitudes against christians are finished christians and other churches are often the only actors who take care of persecuted on the spot but they have no
 we know that they do not care about ireland north or south 
 i want to draw your attention to the fact that fighting against hiv tb and hepatitis is the responsibility of all the actors involved the commission the member states the non governmental organisations social organisations and society in general 
 and on top of this the sector needs support in a transition in order to comply with the goals of the green

 there is now a big debate about access to welfare systems across the eu but whatever we do in the future we should neither compromise the principle of free movement nor should we make it difficult for member states to determine the strength and depth of their own welfare systems 
 they all reinforced our concern for the legal status of asylum seekers because the security was transferred from american troops to iraqi forces from the beginning of this year 
 i love my country and i am really worried 
 on the basis of ambitious design of fp9 we should try to eliminate those gaps completely 
 any decent human being must know in their hearts this sort of exploitation is wrong we as politicians have a duty to lead and to make the hard decisions people are reluctant to make for themselves 
 these people have monstrous led levels in their blood irreversible damage and need immediate and urgent relocation and medical treatment 
 the gas and plastic structure can be used also for the clean hydrogen technology if slightly modified 
 young people my generation cannot wait any more for those people to wake up and realise that without action we condemn our future generations to poverty

 indeed the fdte would have a severe impact on the functioning of debt markets which are essential for governments and companies to raise funds as it would increase both their borrowing and operational costs 
 is it really possible to use other housing facilities with appropriate reception conditions in the meantime 
 not because it is not a glass of european document but simply because it is not responding to what europeans are requesting today 
 mr president in this last annual cfsp report in this lifetime of this parliamentary term i congratulate mr brok but apologise that i have to use my own contribution to warn how the global influence of my own country the united kingdom would suffer as has been demonstrated by the prior contribution if conservative euroscettics get their way and take britain out of the european union 
 so what are we going to create now 
 the dramatic increase in sectarian violence in syria pakistan and iran is an expression of the general instability volatility and that region of the world but this increase is not limited to those states that are listed which coincidentally happen to be the same states that are currently not in favour with western imperialism 
 together this is a major achievement for the future which we as a parliament can be truly proud of 
 firstly the wording in the agreement does not make it binding enough 
 the court still sees scope for further improving the quality of spending by simply applying the current system to its full potential 
 and i m like 
 we have to know that our partners are predictable 
 we can have a new start in europe because in europe what we want is a digital technology that is to implement the european green deal and to make the life of european citizens better

 it is not the lawyers who are benefiting from an exploding number of asylum cases 
 they want civil nominations with everyone having the right to vote 
 the european union has to contribute to the shaping and implementing of the 2030 agenda the agency can do this by providing crucial evidence and consulting skills and consultations at the union level the agency can also contribute to the provision of policy making and knowledge sharing among the union and national actors in particular to governments and social partners i believe that the revision of the functioning of the union and national action plans for the period 2020 and beyond will be a very good opportunity to make sure that the european union is a leader in the global fight against climate change i believe that the revision
 this amorphous data dump of data as well as the staggering profits do not allow for a level playing field for our european industry and it threatens democracies globally 
 firstly it is essential for the european union to strengthen both political and economic ties with the country

 minister von der leyen you promised that you would keep this parliament fully briefed 
 in the by election strategy was mentioned that you must increase the quantity and relevance of its forest notably against fires drives disease and other threats and it is likely to increase climate change 
 if the be concerned 
 europe and the next seven years 
 it is a threat to biodiversity and it will force more and more people to flee their homes because of rising sea levels 
 at the same time we should remember that the operators players and actors in this sector have created a market without too much regulation on their business model
